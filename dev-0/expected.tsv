Bosnians protest Croatian plans for nuclear waste facility
Hundreds of people rallied Friday in northwest Bosnia against plans by neighboring Croatia to store part of the waste from the region's only nuclear plant near its border with Bosnia and a main river known for its natural beauty.
The protesters in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad urged Croatia to abandon plans for a storage site at a former army barracks in Trgovska Gora and pledged to fight the project.
The facility would hold waste from the Krsko nuclear plant.
Holding banners reading "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - the Una (river) needs us," Bosnians they said a nuclear waste facility could endanger the Una River and the lives of around 250,000 area residents.
We have to say NO!
Miroslav Drljaca, the head of Novi Grad municipality told the crowd.
We must fight to preserve our way of life and our Una.
Located in Slovenia, the 1980s" Krsko plant is owned jointly by Croatia.
Officials from the two countries are set to meet next week to discuss additional waste storage facilities.
Croatia's state HRT television reported Friday that Croatia was yet to decide whether it would build storage of its own or pay to store its share of waste at a new facility Slovenia is building.
Croatian Minister of Environment Protection and Energy Tomislav Coric told the broadcaster that Croatia also has a problem disposing of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and was hoping to find an overall solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from all sides of the country's ethnic divide insisted that Croatia find another location in a part of the country nearer to the nuclear.
"How come that out of entire Croatia, the best is the Trgovska Gora pocket that is in Bosnia's pants?" asked Drljaca.
We must not let them humiliate us!

American Congress agreed to sell 32 F-35 jets to Poland
Within 15 days from the Department of State approving the possible purchase of 32 multi-task F-35 jets by Poland, the U.S. Congress did not raise any objection to the transaction, which means that the last condition was met before commencing sales negotiations.
The Congress' decision, although not unexpected, carries large political significance.
"Once the Department of State and now the Congress approved the sales, I see no serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior research fellow for the defence policy at the Washington-based conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.
The expert explained that, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the federal government, represented by the Department of State, is obliged to inform the Congress of each planned sales of arms abroad 15 days before concluding a sales contract, if the value of such transaction, in case of selling arms to a NATO member, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 jets by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount will include costs of technical and logistic aid, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
Should the transaction be finalized, the main supplier of the F-35 jets will be the American arms company Lockheed Martin, with Pratt and Whitney, manufacturer of F-35A jet engines, as its subcontractor.
The offer to purchase 5th generation American F-35 jets on behalf of Poland was submitted by Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of this year, during a meeting held at the White House between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump.
If finalized, the execution of the contract will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon as part of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.
Under the FMS program, Poland has already purchased the Patriot anti-ballistic missile system, among others.
The price of one F-35 jet at the moment when Poland submitted its purchase offer equalled, without arming and technical help, ca. $89.2 million.
As per the information conveyed to the Polish Press Agency by military experts who wanted to remain anonymous, such price given during the initial negotiations was "a maximum price, much higher than the one that will be negotiated".
"The prices are decreasing rapidly; the current price of one F-35 is below $80 million – much less than the cost of a Eurofighter, which does not share the same qualities as F-35", Venable indicated.
Polish Press Agency interlocutors expressed their hopes that the negotiations regarding the purchase of American fighter aircraft by Poland will be completed this year.
Possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this deal, i.e. offset, will be discussed directly with American manufacturers of F-35 jets.
What is Munchhausen's by proxy mentioned in The Politician on Netflix?
The condition means carers or parents pretend their child is ill when they are healthy.
The Politican hits Netflix today.
The show tells the story of Payton Hobart who wants to be President of the United States of America - but first, he has to be student body president at his high school.
Made by American Horror Story and Glee creator Ryan Murphy, it features Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too much for those who haven't had a chance to watch it yet, the show includes a storyline about Munchhausen's by proxy - a mental illness where a carer acts as if the person they are looking after has a physical or mental illness when they are not really sick.
There are different types of the condition, including Munchhausen's where a person pretends that they themselves are ill.
Munchhausen's By Proxy, however, is specifically about making up that someone that you care for is ill.
It is also known as fabricated or induced illness (FII) and is categorised as child abuse.
It is a rare condition and usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms to make it seem like their child is ill.
What are the signs of Munchhausen's by proxy?
The signs of the condition can vary from case to case but the NHS says that things to be aware of include:
Persuading medical professionals that their child is unwell but they seem healthy.
Exaggerating or lying about symptoms.
Manipulating results to suggest the child is ill, for example putting glucose in urine samples to make it look like they have diabetes.
Inducing symptoms of illness, for example giving them unnecessary medication or other substances.
How common is Munchhausen's by proxy?
As many cases aren't reported, it's difficult to know how widespread the condition is.
One study published in 2000 estimated 89 cases in a population of 100,000 over a two year period.
What should you do if you think a child is at risk
You can contact your local social services department or telephone the NSPCC's child protection helpline on 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police Raid Kaduna School, Evacuate 300 Children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police Command yesterday raided a school, Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal, located at Layin Maidubun Tsumma at Rigasa in Igabi Local Government Area of the state, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police alleged that the children were kept in a very dehumanising condition; an allegation the school authority denied.
A resident who identified himself as Shehu, a preacher in the school, said: "What they're saying is not true because all the children are there with the consent of their parents.
The parents signed a form before the children were enrolled in the school.
The parents used to bring food to their children daily and they also know the condition they are in.
We were very surprised when the police came and evacuated the children as well as removed all the students' food brought by their parents before they shut down the school.
This is unfair because we have parents to testify if their children are kept in bad conduction as claimed by the police.
He added that the immediate past Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to see how the children were taken care, never complained.
‎He said the children only studied Quran and nothing else.
But the Police Command Public Relations Officer, Yakubu Sabo, said the children would be reunited with their parents after handing them over to the state government.
"They were kept in dehumanising condition in the name of undergoing or acquiring Quranic knowledge.
With many of them with scars on their back which show they were beaten.
So, we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility," he said.
Foreign talent important to China's development
Guangdong has been leading the country in terms of attracting foreign talent, due in a large part to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and Shenzhen's new role as a pilot demonstration area.
Nanfang Media Group has interviewed seven expatriates aged from 10-70 in Guangdong.
Born in 2010 during the Asian Games in Guangzhou, Yash from Singapore said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientific doctor in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrov, a Russian student of Shenzhen MSU-BIT University said, "With the BRI, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
We can make new ideas and businesses together.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the US started her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over one million fans on Bilibili and Weibo.
She said she will keep sharing Chinese traditions, culture and technology through her videos.
Leticia de Lassus from France, the head of JJB International Montessori AMI Centers in Guangzhou, agrees that "children's education is like buttoning up one's jacket.
If the first button is fastened incorrectly, the rest will never find their rightful place.
Chinese-American Henry Xiao believes that at the heart of GBA, his company can enjoy multiple benefits in terms of new policies, government policies and capitals, especially the talent.
Nanta Show producer Sean Choi from South Korea said Guangdong cuisine is famous all over the world, and it has been good to introduce the Nanta Show to Guangdong.
Stephan Mohler from Switzerland, the technical quality director at the Pearl River Pianos, thinks the secret of high quality lies in simple work done well.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China enjoy working, learn to make good products and persist in their drive to be better.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Blonska will be next president
I think that Donald Tusk and Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska stand a chance to win the presidential election against President Andrzej Duda, says Tomasz Siemioniak.
Deputy leader of Civic Platform was interviewed by Polsat News about the affair including the head of the Supreme Audit Office.
This matter makes Marian Banas stand on the losing side.
He may become culture minister to deal with some kind of entertainment, but not the Head of the Supreme Audit Office or finance minister.
He shouldn't be the one in charge of billions and taxes, he said.
This is a very severe state crisis, he added.
Siemioniak also elaborated about Klaudia Jachira's run for election.
Law and Justice has Antoni Macierewicz on its election lists.
This is a person who not only said some things, but also did them.
He accused former Military Counter-intelligence Service bosses of espionage on behalf of Russia, he destroyed their life and their families.
Why nobody insists that Antoni Macierewicz is out of election, he asked.
Those younger than us have a different sense of taste.
I think that Jachira who already apologized for one of the things feels that she may exaggerate sometimes.
For me, it is not an election campaign problem, he added.
Tourists Return to Poland as Scheduled Following the Bankruptcy of Neckermann Poland Travel Agency
According to the office, it has not been necessary to bring the tourists to Poland prematurely so far.
It was declared that "the office has been paying any unpaid hotel nights using the insurance guarantee gradually".
On 25 September Neckermann Poland Travel Agency filed a statement of insolvency in the Marshall Office.
At the time when the Agency submitted the statement of insolvency, there were 3,600 tourists abroad.
On Wednesday, the group of ca. 500 people came back to Poland, and on Thursday a group of 230.
On Friday, subsequent 350 people are to come back from Morocco, Spain and Greece.
The tourists will land in Katowice and Warsaw (there will be five chartered flights altogether).
Some of them will come by commercial flights.
It is planned ca. 1,000 tourists staying on holiday e.g. in Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy should come back home on the weekend.
According to the Marshall Office of the Voivodeship of Mazovia, the Travel Agency sold ca. 20 thousand trips for autumn and winter.
"Those travel agency customers should contact the insurer directly, meaning Allianz Partners", the office reminded.
It added also that "the situation of tourists who signalled any problems in the hotels seems stabilised for the time being and any emerging incidents of tourists expelled from hotels were patched up together with the consular services."
Last Friday the authorities of the largest and also the oldest travel agency Thomas Cook informed it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH was the owner of 100 percent of shares in Neckermann Poland.
'Hideous' Central Coast camouflage child rapist ordered to look at victim in court
Dressed in a leafy Ghillie camouflage suit, the man grabbed the then 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into bushland as she made her way to school on the state's Central Coast in May 2017.
He then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the grooming and sexual abuse of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bushes armed with a large tree branch and a knife.
When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he put her in a headlock and forced her into the scrub.
The man told the girl: "Shhh, don't scream.
Don't scream or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before lashing her to the tree and abusing her for almost an hour.
After he cut her loose, the girl ran crying hysterically to school.
The man arrived at work about 9.30am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues.
With dirt, grass and tree matter on his clothes, he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had chased another driver into the bush and fallen down an embankment.
The man's sentencing hearing continues on Tuesday.
Pope warns tech execs to use AI for the common good
Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.
Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists.
A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at "The Common Good in the Digital Age" conference.
The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.
The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.
In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor.
But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.
"If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned.
If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
Organizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants' expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues.
Martin Odegaard, Real Madrid Loanee, Sends Fans Wild With Mind-Boggling Assist.
Martin Odegaard provided a jaw-dropping assist for Mikel Oyarzabal's opener.
Real Madrid went top of the La Liga table following their 2-0 win over Osasuna as they continued their unbeaten run in this year's domestic season.
However, despite not losing a single game in La Liga this season, manager Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure following a tumultuous pre-season and a public rift with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The pressure seemed to reach the boiling point when Real Madrid were humiliated by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG) in the Champions League.
But Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid have some real talent on their books, some who are currently in the Frenchman's plans and those that aren't.
Vinícius Junior is one such star for the future for Real Madrid and is currently with the team.
However, another Norwegian youngster Martin Odegaard, who has been loaned out to Real Sociedad, is creating a flutter after providing a mind-boggling assist during a La Liga match.
Playing for Real Sociedad vs Alaves, Martin Odegaard provided a jaw-dropping assist for Mikel Oyarzabal's opener as Real Sociedad ran out 3-0 winners at home.
After picking the ball up on the right, Martin Odegaard drifted away from one opponent by nutmegging him and then threaded a stunning pass inside two more for his teammate to get at the of the inch-perfect through-ball and poke home.
Willian Jose's second and a third from the impressive Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty spot, secured a convincing win for Imanol's side, before Alaves midfielder Manu Garcia was sent off with five minutes to play.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid aged just 16 in 2015 but has struggled to live up to the hype.
Now 20, the Norwegian youngster finally appears to be finding his feet.
Anna Hazare Surprised Sharad Pawar's Name Figures In Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank Scam Case
Anna Hazare said "Sharad Pawar's name was not on the list when this case came to me"
Social activist Anna Hazare has expressed surprise over Nationalist Congress Party or NCP chief Sharad Pawar's name cropping up in the multi-crore Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank scam.
Probe agency Enforcement Directorate or ED has filed a money laundering case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar - a former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra - and others in connection with the scam.
An Enforcement Case Information Report, equivalent to a police FIR, has been registered by the central agency under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on a Mumbai Police FIR which had named former chairmen of the bank, Ajit Pawar, and 70 erstwhile functionaries of the cooperative lender.
When this case came to me, Sharad Pawar's name was not there anywhere.
How did his name crop up, who mentioned his name, all these things only they know," Anna Hazare said on Thursday when asked about the ED case and Sharad Pawar's alleged links to the scam.
Anna Hazare, a Sharad Pawar critic, expressed the hope that the truth will come out after the ED carries out a detailed investigation in the scam.
"The ED will come to know how his name figured in the case," said Anna Hazare, a veteran of many anti-corruption agitations.
Sharad Pawar has denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was not associated with the bank in any capacity and questioned the timing of the registration of the case which comes just weeks ahead of the October 21 Assembly polls in Maharashtra.
The former Union minister has asserted he would not bow before the "throne" of Delhi, apparently referring to the BJP-led government at the Centre.
The NCP has termed the Enforcement Directorate case as politically motivated.
A busy day for Polish Border Guards.
Yesterday, several smugglers failed to take stolen goods, whose value exceeded PLN 130 thousand, to Ukraine.
All events were reported yesterday (26 September) on route from Poland.
In Korczowa, a Romanian citizen was carrying a Specialized e-bike.
The Polish Border Guards officers, determining the item's legality of origin, contacted representatives of German Police and quickly established that this modern single-track vehicle, worth about PLN 10 thousand, was stolen from their territory.
A few hours later, also in Korczowa, the Border Guards, while checking a semi-trailer registered in France, found that the VIN number was altered.
The driver of the combination truck was a citizen of Ukraine.
The semi-trailer, worth about PLN 30 thousand, was confiscated and will be submitted to detailed expertise in order to establish its original data.
At the crossing point in Medyka, Border Guard officers thwarted an attempt to take another stolen Can-am quad bike (year of manufacture: 2019).
The value of the vehicle, transported on a car hauler, is estimated at PLN 75 thousand.
The driver of the combination truck was a 32-year-old citizen of Ukraine.
The Border Guards confirmed that just two weeks ago a quad bike was reported missing in Poland and was sought-after all over Europe.
In Medyka, a "partial" attempt to take a stolen vehicle across the border was also thwarted.
A 41-year-old Ukrainian bus traveller was transporting car body elements coming from an exclusive Mercedes.
All car identification numbers had been mechanically removed.
The car body elements, worth about PLN 15 thousand, were confiscated.
South Africa: Man, 20, Charged With Murder of Ukzn Student Sinethemba Ndlovu
A man who was arrested in connection with the murder of University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) student Sinethemba Ndlovu is expected to apply for bail next week, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).
The accused appeared in the Msinga Magistrate's Court on Thursday on a charge of murder.
KZN NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara told News24 that the case was postponed to October 2 for the bail application.
She added that the State would oppose the accused's release on bail.
According to KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the 20-year-old accused was arrested on Monday.
Ndlovu was stabbed below her left armpit and stomach, police said earlier this week.
It's believed that she worked as a hostess at the Msinga Driftkhana motorsport event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued that day, organisers of the motorsport event said preliminary reports suggested that a few hostesses remained behind after the event to watch some of the musical performances after their shift ended.
On their way, sadly, one of them was attacked by unknown men and later passed [a]way in hospital," their statement read.
UKZN suspended academic activities on Friday, saying "the circumstances of Ndlovu's death requires us as a community to pause and reflect on the fragility of life, and the brutality that often exists in our society."
Mylan agrees to pay $30M in EpiPen settlement
Mylan has agreed to pay $30 million in a settlement tied to its failure to tell investors about a Justice Department investigation into whether the company overcharged Medicaid for the EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday that Mylan NV classified the EpiPen as a "generic" drug under the Medicaid drug rebate program.
This led to the pharmaceutical company paying much lower rebates to the government than if the EpiPen had been classified as a "branded" drug.
Mylan had disclosed in July that it had reached an agreement-in-principle with the SEC on the matter.
The company said in a statement Friday that it neither admits nor denies the SEC's allegations.
Is it divine retribution?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, serious illness, death of a child.
These are tragedies that cause a great deal of suffering and are hard to understand.
We ask: "Why?".
We sometimes hear "that was God's will".
Is it the Creator who sends us all woes and diseases?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life.
When Nick Vujicic was coming into the world 36 years ago, his dad ran out of the labour room in fear.
"My son doesn't have arms or legs," he screamed to the doctor.
The parents didn't know that their child suffered from an incurable illness that made him limbless.
Initially, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed and after four months, Nick's mom felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Now, Vujicic is a world-renowned evangelist and motivational speaker, thanks to whom many people have converted.
"I am proof that God never makes mistakes," Nick emphasises.
"When we are gripped by suffering, it is hard to understand it.
We look for reasons.
We ask: «Why has it happened to us?»
If we believe that God reigns over the whole world and is in control of our lives, it is natural that we ask whether He sent us illness, misfortune..."
Mother pleads guilty to murdering two teenage sons
A woman broke down in tears as she was told she could spend the rest of her life in prison after admitting murdering her two teenage sons while conspiring to kill four more of her children.
Sarah Barrass, 35, pleaded guilty to the murder of Tristan Barrass, 13, and Blake Barrass, 14.
The brothers died in hospital 12 minutes apart after police were called to the Shiregreen area of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, at about 7.30am on 24 May.
Postmortems have been carried out but the results were not given during a hearing on Friday at Sheffield crown court.
The exact circumstances surrounding the boys' deaths are not yet known.
Barrass appeared in the dock alongside her co-defendant, Brandon Machin, 39, a family member.
Flanked by three security officers, they pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to murder six children.
The pair also pleaded guilty to five counts of attempted murder during the 20-minute hearing.
The conspiracy to murder charges relate to a period between 14 and 20 May.
Four of the attempted murder charges relate to four children, including Blake and Tristan on 23 May.
The fifth count of attempted murder took place on 24 May.
The surviving children are all under the age of 13.
The judge, Jeremy Richardson QC, told the pair: "No words of mine can ever fully reflect the enormity of what you have both done.
The crimes you have committed quite frankly speak for themselves.
The murder of two children.
The attempted murder of four children and the overarching conspiracy to murder those children.
I have little doubt that each of you will in due course be sentenced to several terms of life imprisonment."
It's a matter for the judge where a whole life order is imposed.
They will be sentenced on 12 November.
A Member of Parliament for the Civic Platform party, Krzysztof Bejza, sues Cezary Gmyza.
"With regard to the campaign of lies of the Law and Justice TV, I am filing a suit against Cezary Gmyza," a Member of Parliament for the Civic Platform party, Krzysztof Brejza, announced on Twitter.
The reason for the claim is Cezary Gmyz's statement made on the "Minęła 20" programme on channel TVP.
One of the main people managing the SokzBuraka website is Krzysztof Brejza, who has a lot of experience in organising the envy department.
"Kierwiński, Budka and Giertych are people who know Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda very well, and he is the person who he set up that hate profile", Gmyz said.
SokzBuraka is a website and social network profile with memes and jokes about politics.
According to Sieci magazine, Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda, a public relations person, is responsible for that profile.
"We managed to find out that since this April Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in Warsaw's City Hall in the Marketing Office," we can read in the magazine.
"Confederation" in Oława
There was a meeting held by the "Confederation" Electoral Committee at the market square in Oława.
The programme was presented by Krzysztof Szokalski, no. 5 on the list, and Halszka Bielecka, no. 9.
The announced list leader, Krzysztof Tuduj, did not arrive at the campaign rally.
The candidates mentioned many problems, from the excessive fiscalism of the state to the healthcare problems.
Another issue discussed was the economic zone which should operate for the benefit of all entrepreneurs and not favour the foreign capital.
Climate strike in Budapest – World
A few thousand of people, mostly young ones, took part in a climate strike in the capital of Hungary, Budapest, on Friday.
They called on the government to reach climate neutrality, declare a state of climate threat and to run a more environmental agenda.
Protesters marched from Clark's square at the Buda side to the Kossuth square outside the parliament on the Pest side.
The people chanted: "What do we want?
Climate protection!
When do we want it?
Now!".
Boris Johnson referred to police watchdog over friendship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now assess whether the Prime Minister should be investigated for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was mayor of London.
The Greater London Authority (GLA) said in a statement that the authority's monitoring officer had recorded a "conduct matter" against the Prime Minister over allegations Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him.
"A "conduct matter" exists where there is information that indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed," it said.
It does not mean that this is proved in any way.
The IOPC will now consider if it is necessary for the matter to be investigated.
The issue has been referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales.
It was referred to the watchdog because Mr Johnson at the time held the post equivalent to a police and crime commissioner.
Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Ms Arcuri.
Earlier he said that he would comply with an order by the London Assembly to provide details of his links with Ms Arcuri, although he insisted they were "barking up the wrong tree."
It follows a report by The Sunday Times that Ms Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was given £126,000 in public money and was treated to privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor.
The Government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Ms Arcuri's company, Hacker House, pending a review.
It is facing embarrassing questions about the verification process carried out before awarding the money.
Digital Minister Matt Warman told the Commons that his department had done the "usual due diligence" and that the company had a British phone number.
However, numerous reports said calls to the number were directed to an office in California, where Ms Arcuri, 34, is said to now be based.
PM's friendship with businesswoman 'was open secret among staff'
The move by the GLA to refer the Prime Minister to the Independent Office for Police Conduct has met with anger from No 10.
A senior Government source said it was "a politically motivated attack" and that the timing - on the eve of the Conservative Party conference - was "overtly political."
"No evidence of any allegations has been provided by the monitoring officer nor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night," the source said.
The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job.
Earlier today, the Standard was told Mr Johnson's close friendship with the Californian entrepreneur helped by London's tourism and promotions agency was an "open secret" among its staff.
Former officials at the agency, London  Partners (LP), recalled how Ms Arcuri was given places on foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson in his time as mayor despite her companies being regarded as "not credible" by some at the time.
Third man charged with drug counts in Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offenses in connection with rapper Mac Miller's overdose death last year.
Court documents show Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that Miller possessed before he died last September of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a powerful opioid contributing to an epidemic that's claimed thousands of lives in the U.S.
Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Court documents unsealed Tuesday say Pettit kept getting drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is accused of serving as Walter's "runner" who delivered the pills to Pettit.
None of the men have been directly charged with Miller's death or have entered pleas in their cases.
Walter, who is on supervised release in a 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been ordered to serve five months in prison for violating the terms of his release.
Prosecutors handling the case, which was first reported Thursday by celebrity website TMZ, are asking that Walter remain in custody while he awaits trial, calling him a serious flight risk.
A phone message left with his lawyer wasn't immediately returned.
Pettit was charged in federal court on Sept. 4, and his attorney has declined to comment.
Miller's rhymes included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.
The Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick was also in a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018.
After his death, she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, "Thank U Next," that lovingly mentioned him.
Miller is among the musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to opioid abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016 and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.
This story has been corrected to show that Walter's first name is spelled Stephen, not Steven.
9 year old Nigerian builds more than 30 mobile games
The 9-year-old is building a hide and seek game, using a free programming application called Scratch 2.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations, and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has used it to generate more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game involves a bat he has programmed to hide.
The player gets a point every time he catches the bat when it emerges from its hiding place.
I learned how to build games at a boot camp.
"Now, I build to keep me busy when I am bored," Basil told CNN.
In March, his father signed him up for a five-day boot camp for children aged 5 to 15.
The camp, organized by Codefest International, was put in place to give children like Basil access to emerging technologies like robotics and virtual reality.
Growing up, Basil used to play a lot of mobile games says his father, Basil Okpara Sr.
"I bought him a tablet when he was 4 years old because I saw that he was always grabbing phones to play games with.
He played Candy Crush and Temple Run a lot," the father told CNN.
But Basil's interest in creating his games grew at age 7 after he got scolded for spending all of his time playing.
"There was this day he was on the tablet, as usual, he was so carried away with the game he was playing that I got upset with him," his father said.
Out of annoyance, I said to him, 'you are always playing games, can't you think about building your own games so others can play yours too?'.
I was angry when I said it, and I did not know he took it seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil actively showed interest in learning how to make his own games, prompting his parents to buy him a laptop and register him to learn the first steps of building games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, titles his games based on what they are about.
One of his games, 'Mosquito mash' is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest youth population in the world, and like Basil, this population is taking the lead when it comes to innovation on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds were recently celebrated for using codes to build robots to sort out their house chores.
In May, team Acrobot, a Ghanaian all-girls high school team won the 2019 Robofest competition by programming robots to stack boxes.
And with Africa experiencing increased investment from tech giants like Google and Microsoft, Basil and his peers are on their way to becoming future coding stars.
Former North Carolina GOP Chair To Plead Guilty For Lying In Bribery Probe
A former North Carolina GOP chairman will admit in court that he lied to federal agents conducting a bribery investigation of a major political donor, according to court documents filed Friday.
The federal court docket shows that Robin Hayes is scheduled to enter a guilty plea next Wednesday.
A factual basis document prepared as part of the plea agreement and signed by Hayes' attorney said that Hayes knew he was making false statements to FBI agents conducting the bribery probe in 2018.
The actual plea agreement is sealed, and the factual basis doesn't specify which charges he'll plead guilty to.
He was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery and making false statements.
Prosecutors have accused Hayes, a former congressman, of involvement in an insurance executive's plan to funnel campaign contributions to the state's top insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
The executive, Greg Lindberg, and two of his associates have been charged with attempting to bribe state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is an insurance and investment firm founder who has been among the state's top political donors in recent years, giving more than $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He favored Republican causes and politicians, but also gave to Democrats.
His attorney did not respond to an email seeking comment Friday.
A defense attorney for Hayes, Kearns Davis, didn't respond to an email Friday seeking further comment.
The court documents filed Friday state that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had never had conversations with Causey about staff at the state Department of Insurance.
But Hayes had in fact spoken to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to make personnel changes within the regulator's agency, according to the factual basis document.
Prosecutors have said that Hayes also helped Lindberg request a meeting with Causey and that Hayes discussed the bribe directly with the regulator.
An indictment unsealed in April alleges that Lindberg wanted special treatment for his insurance businesses and planned to funnel up to $2 million for Causey's 2020 reelection campaign.
The scheme involved a request to replace a department official who had been examining a Lindberg company, according to the indictment.
Causey, a Republican, reported the alleged attempted bribe to federal investigators and helped them build their case.
He faces no charges.
The indictment states that an associate of Lindberg's directed Hayes to transfer $250,000 to Causey's reelection campaign during a conversation that also included Lindberg and Causey.
Hayes initially protested, saying that moving so much money would draw attention, but eventually relented during the conversation, according to the indictment.
"Whatever you all want to do, we'll do," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"Alright, I'll get "er done."
A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office didn't respond to an email seeking further information about the plea agreement.
Drivers to Go Along the First Section of the New Zakopianka
From Saturday, the drivers will be able to use the first out of three constructed mountain sections of the S7 express road, meaning the new Zakopianka, from Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdrój, and next the main fast traffic dual-carriageway road to Chabówka.
As reported by the spokeswoman of the Krakow branch of the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA), Iwona Mikrut, on Friday, it is the first out of three sections of the constructed S7 route south of Krakow, from Lubień to Rabka Zdrój, which will be put into use.
In the section more than 6 km long from Skomielna Biała to Chabówka, more than one third, i.e.
ca. 2.3 km, was led on bridges.
There are seventeen of them, including the longest and highest one, one kilometre long and 50 m high, as well as four small structures over the watercourses at Skomielna interchange.
From this interchange, there are exits to Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, road no. 28 and to the former course of DK7, provided.
From the following interchange, Zabornia, you can change to DK47 towards Nowy Targ and Zakopane and to DK7 to Chyżne and the Poland-Slovakia border.
There was a passenger service area created on Zbójecka Góra.
The express road ends with Zabornia interchange in Rabka Zdrój, with an about one-kilometre dual-carriageway section of DK47 to Chabówka added, where it is connected to the existing dual-carriageway road connecting Chabówka and Rdzawka.
The S7 section Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój and the new section of the national fast traffic (GP) road no. 47 from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka was constructed by Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The project cost was ca. PLN 615 million.
The Defects Liability for the works performed will be valid for 10 years.
The section of the new Zakopianka of ca. 16.7 km, including 15.8 km with the express road parameters, was divided into three implementation parts, each with its separate contractor: Lubień – Naprawa, Naprawa – Skomielna Biała and Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój.
The first section from the entrance to the tunnel is made by the Polish-Ukrainian consortium of IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and ALTIS-HOLDING from Kiev, the tunnel section by Italian Astaldi, and the third by the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of those tasks is close to PLN 2.5 billion.
The project is co-funded from the European Union Funds within the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014–2020.
The funding amounts to more than PLN 1.3 billion.
Along the entire section, there are 38 road structures created (bridges, overbridges, long bridges) and a two-chamber tunnel 2.06 km long.
According to the statement of the road administrator, the 7.6 km long section from Lubień to Naprawa will be put into use this year, with a temporary connection to the old DK7 road which will be used by drivers to bypass the tunnel construction site.
The last section Naprawa – Skomielna Biała 3 km long will be used by drivers in 2021, after the two-chamber tunnel construction is completed, with every carriageway ca. 2.06 km long.
Our goal is a welfare state
"We are building a welfare state in Poland", announced the Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to persuade constituents to vote for a councillor, Dariusz Matecki, a candidate for the Sejm from the Law and Justice's list.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the Polish version of a prosperity state strategy," the Minister said.
"We want Poles to earn much more money so that their lives will be on a much higher level.
This is a must, because otherwise young, high-achieving, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot allow that.
Our administration, for four years, has consistently implemented the programme we obliged to carry out four years ago.
We said we would launch the 500 plus programme.
The Civic Platform party, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopacz said it would not be possible, that this money does not exist.
We proved that we have and had the money, only the Civic Platform did not take care of those to whom the money was supposed to go.
Ziobro also reminded voters about school starter kits and the thirteenth pension – and that there are plans for a fourteenth pension.
In addition to "prudent division of national income", the Law and Justice priorities are: just state and economic development.
"The money should not go in big streams only into the pockets of the chosen ones, who have good relations with the Establishment and Authorities, but should be evenly distributed among the whole of society", the politician said.

Section of Sopocka street in Nisko already rebuilt
On Tuesday, 24th September, the Sopocka street in Nisko was officially opened for traffic.
The total costs of the works amounted to PLN 1 million 803 thousands, among which PLN 1 million 26 thousands were financed from FDS and the remaining amount is the financial contribution of the Nisko District as well as the Nisko Commune and the City of Nisko.
Thanks to the financial resources, the road surface of 1284 metres length was laid and extended. The works included also the pavement of 950 metres length, dewatering as well as finishing works.
The investment was realized by the following companies: PBI Infrastruktura S.A. from Krasnik and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. from Sandomierz.

Facebook to hide number of likes in trial aimed at improving users' wellbeing
Some Facebook users will soon no longer see the number of likes, reactions and video views on other's posts in a world-first trial aimed at boosting users' wellbeing.
Instead, likes will be private and only visible to the post's author in a change that follows a similar test on Instagram which started in July in Australia.
The new Facebook trial, which begins on Friday, will also kick off in Australia.
Facebook Australia's director of policy Mia Garlick said the change was based on wellbeing research and feedback from mental health professionals that the number of likes can cause social comparison.
"We've had really positive feedback from a lot of the anti-bullying groups and mental health organisations that we work with," Garlick said.
It really is just taking that number out of the equation, so that people can focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of the content rather than on the number of likes or reactions.
It's hoped that people will be more comfortable with sharing on the platform rather than feeling like it's a competition, she said.
Garlick assured businesses who rely on Facebook they will still receive all the same metrics and insights they previously accessed.
She said it was too early to say if the test would roll out to other countries like Instagram's trial has in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, there is no indication of when the trial will end or if the change will be made permanent.
"We have had some initial positive feedback from the public about the experience [on Instagram], but we're still just learning and listening to feedback at this stage," she said.
On being the world's training ground Garlick said Australia has very active "tech-savvy" users of Facebook and Instagram.
We think this is a great country where we can get some really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people on our services or not.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims from the Curia
The Curia of Częstochowa has not yet commented on the councillors' appeal to the local metropolitan Archbishop Wacław Depo on providing financial compensation for the management of the waste disposal during pilgrimage season.
The city requests PLN 1 from every pilgrim.
The Vice-Chairperson of the Częstochowa City Council and candidate for the Sejm, Łukasz Kot, spoke about the speech addressed to the metropolitan archbishop during a press conference, in which a leader of the Spring party, Robert Biedroń, took part, held on Friday on Holy Virgin Mary Avenue leading up to the Jasna Góra Monastery.
Kot announced that the day before that local councillors from the Democratic Left Alliance party passed the appeal to archbishop Wacław Depo on passing on to the city one PLN from each pilgrim visiting Częstochowa to support the work of municipal services.
We adopted the appeal to the Archbishop Depo so he would help the city, help us clean up after the pilgrims, and prepare for pilgrims.
"We ask that a symbolic one zloty from every pilgrim be transferred to the city budget.
Thanks to that, the city can provide them with better conditions of stay in Częstochowa", said the Vice-Chairperson of the City Council.
When asked for comment, the Metropolitan Curia of Częstochowa's spokesman, priest Mariusz Bakalarz, at first provided a longer response, then, however, he asked – as he indicated, on behalf of Archbishop Depo – to replace it with the following information: "We will not refer to that matter until the City Council takes an official position on this issue."
According to the project published on the websites of the Częstochowa City Council, the appeal to the Archbishop Depo refers to "transferring financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for maintaining the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season.
"With regard to the growing number of pilgrims coming to Częstochowa and increasing cost of maintaining the municipal waste management system in pilgrimage season, taking into consideration the image of the city among its inhabitants and pilgrims, as a part of generally accepted canons of caring for our common good, our little homeland Częstochowa, we would like to propose the Curia's participation in the costs of maintaining the above-mentioned waste management system," states a fragment of the appeal.
"Striving to maintain the cleanliness of areas for pedestrian and motor traffic used by pilgrims, who, at the same time, make use of small infrastructure, i.e. outdoor waste bins, we will introduce symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system amounting to PLN 1 from each pilgrim", the appeal continues.
"What is more, in relation to the participation in annual costs, which will be covered by the city's own resources, taking care of cleanliness and aesthetics of the urban space, but also with emphasis that this cooperation will bring benefits to all the involved parties, we declare that 20% from the above-mentioned amount will be allocated to the tourist infrastructure improvement, for instance for building more toilets available to the public," the councillors stated.
They also highlighted that besides financial matters, their proposal results from the numerous reservations from inhabitants about the cleanliness of routes used by pilgrims.
"Taking into account the cleanliness of our city and the potential positive effects of cooperation, the Częstochowa City Council calls on Wacław Depo, the metropolitan archbishop of Częstochowa, to transfer financial compensation to Częstochowa for the maintenance of municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season," they repeated in the appeal.
According to the information from the Jasna Góra press office, over the course of the last year, 834 thousand people joined 200 nationwide pilgrimages in Poland to the shrine.
About 124 thousand believers took part in 255 walking pilgrimages.
More than 8,8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in cycling pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 people (16 groups) in running pilgrimages.
Nearly 20 people reached the shrine on horseback, and more than 170 pilgrimages in two groups on rollerblades.
TVP "Wiadomości" ignored Confederation while describing the opinion poll
According to a survey performed by Pollster, in elections to the Sejm, Law and Justice would obtain 45% votes, Civic Coalition 26%, The Left 14%, PSL 7% and Confederation 5% votes.
Even the "Super Express", web portal the survey was performed for, reported exceeding the electoral threshold.
In the prime time "Wiadomości" edition describing the survey, the results for only four parties were presented, completely ignoring Confederation.
The presenter Edyta Lewandowska clearly emphasised that only four committees exceeded the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
TVP viewers were also presented a division of seats in the Sejm without the votes given to Confederation..
It would provide Law and Justice with independent rule.
Krzysztof Bosak in his comment to the whole situation described it as "public disgrace in terms of honesty towards society".
"They started from slogans about «moral revolution», he recalled and said that the case was the sign of weakness.
By contrast, Robert Winnicki on Twitter wrote that "TVP Wiadomości" in subsequent steps against Confederation put Urban and Michnik to shame.
He also emphasised the lack of response of right-wing journalists.
"We let’s also look at those who are permissively silent.
Those «honest», «independent», «disobedient» ones.
Within a few years they became a primitive version of the whole thing they had been seemingly fighting against.

Brother Jailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch's Honour Killing
Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country's highest-profile "honour killing."
Baloch, who shot to fame for her risque selfies -- tame by Western standards, but considered provocative in deeply misogynistic Pakistan -- was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
Days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did, saying that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been "intolerable."
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in a long-awaited verdict.
"Inshallah (God willing), he will be acquitted by a high court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent.
She was my daughter and he is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder made international headlines and reignited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called "honour killings," in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for flouting patriarchal social codes.
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Baloch's case -- bringing "shame" on their family by celebrating their sexuality.
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative.
Under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, they can then seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives.
Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation mandating life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion, meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardoned.
In Baloch's case, her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absolution.
But, heartbroken at the thought of losing him also, they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven.
International revulsion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents, however, forcing the case to move ahead.
Some of Baloch's better-known actions included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.
She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many, including young people, as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, political act of women's empowerment.
The roots of "honour" killings lie in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular, though men can be victims too.

Lawlessness double displaced from NW Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
Worsening violence has doubled the number of people displaced from northwest Nigeria to some 40,000 over the past four months, the United Nations said on Friday.
The UN's refugee agency said the turmoil had created a "new humanitarian emergency" that would require a fresh inter-agency fundraising effort of $35.5 million by the end of the year.
UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said Boko Haram, the Islamist group that has waged a decade-long insurgency in the north of the country, was not responsible for the latest attacks.
Rather, the upsurge of violence in the past 10 months in Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina states in Nigeria was the work of organized armed groups.
"It paints a horrible picture of lawlessness and insecurity," he told journalists on Friday.
He said there were frequent reports of kidnapping, torture, extortion, murder and sexual violence by attackers who also destroy homes and steal property.
Military and police have been deployed to tackle criminal gangs in the region.
But the military is stretched from fights against Boko Haram and Islamic State's West Africa branch, which split from the former group in 2016.
"The refugees are not coming with names of groups," he said.
What they are coming with are horrific accounts.
Those fleeing are mostly crossing into neighboring Niger.
In a statement, the UNHCR said it expected more to flee to Niger in the coming months as the security situation, particularly in Sokoto state, deteriorates.
New trial date set for man accused of killing woman, 2 kids
A new trial date has been scheduled for a Guatemala man accused of killing an Iowa woman and her two children.
Polk County District Court records say 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is charged with three counts of first-degree murder under what authorities say was a false name he initially gave to police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He's pleaded not guilty.
Police say he fatally shot 29-year-old Rossibeth Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son on July 16 in a Des Moines home.
Court records show the new trial date of Jan. 27 will give attorneys for both sides more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have said Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and had twice been deported before the shooting.
He was convicted in 2010 of illegal entry into the U.S.
Boris Johnson faces Cabinet revolt to lower Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with Brussels - The Sun
With just three weeks to go until a showdown EU leaders' summit, fears are growing around the PM's top table that he is running out of time to win major concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a Cabinet revolt to lower his Brexit demands and cut a compromise deal with the EU.
Negotiators are deadlocked over a new customs system to replace the Irish backstop, with Brussels branding Mr Johnson's alternative arrangements proposals as "unworkable."
Senior ministers expect EU power brokers - led by Germany's Angela Merkel - to offer the embattled Tory leader a last minute compromise, such as a three year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun has spoken to three different Cabinet ministers, who are all preparing to confront him after the Tories" annual conference in Manchester next week.
They will demand he abandons the "aggressive" strategy devised by senior aide Dominic Cummings to try to bluff the EU with the threat of No Deal, and insist he accepts the EU's last minute offer.
One Cabinet minister dubbed the crushing Supreme Court verdict to end Parliament's suspension on Tuesday as "a wake-up call," adding: "A deal is the only way we can leave on October 31 now.
We're never going to beat the numbers in the Commons, and they are against us.
The PM has to lean in now and take what he can get.
Being aggressive doesn't work, the Cummings plan has clearly failed.
We just can't fight battles on so many fronts.
A second Cabinet minister has vowed to tell Mr Johnson to try to push through ex-PM Theresa May's deal if all else fails.
That senior minister added: "I will tell Boris to put Theresa's deal back to the Commons if I have to."
The numbers are there for it now, everyone is desperate to end this.
It's all over for Boris and it's all over for all of us if we're forced to extend.
Sir John Major accused Boris of not taking the negotiation seriously.
In a withering speech, the former Tory premier said: "The Prime Minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe.
But we don't see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement.
Instead, we do see him wrestling with bulls in Scotland; inspecting eggs in Wales; and arguing with the public in high streets - for all the world as if an election campaign was already in full swing."
The PM's spokesman yesterday admitted a deal was still far off, saying: "No one should be under any illusion - there is a very long way to go if we are to secure a deal."
But the spokesman also said the Benn Act to enforce a three months delay if there is no deal was "actively undermining our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that it has hindered our negotiating position but the Prime Minister and colleagues through hard work have continued to try and make progress in the face of that piece of legislation."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay goes back to Brussels today for more talks with the EU's Michel Barnier.
They will discuss a paper on how an all-Ireland zone on food and livestock would work.
Noseless and legless dog conquers Instagram .
Perfectly imperfect
The mongrel was supposed to be put down.
However, it has been successfully prevented.
The little bitch was transferred from Romania to the UK by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love at first sight with the animal.
"In the beginning I found it difficult to convince my husband to adopt her, because we already had three dogs", she said.
The woman made a decision to take care of the bitch until somebody adopts her.
However, there was still nobody to pick her up.
"The fact that nobody wanted to take care of her made me more and more eager to look after her.
She was sensitive and needed love", communicated Kate.
Finally, the married couple decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her as she is, and if somebody does not like the way she looks, that’s their problem, not ours", said the woman.
As time went by Bonnie became a social media star.
She has more than 14 thousand followers on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told I'd never make it in TV with a Glasgow accent
Lorraine Kelly revealed that TV bosses told her she would "never make it" as a presenter because of her Glaswegian accent.
Looking back on 35 years in broadcasting, Kelly, 59, recalled how she felt "very nervous" ahead of her first appearance on screen.
"I was only 25 and very nervous," she said.
I had been working as a researcher at BBC Scotland and been told by the big boss that I would never make it in TV because of my Glasgow accent.
I went down to London to meet all of the TV-am team and see the show being broadcast, before taking over at the Glasgow office.
I will never forget, Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing the icon that is Bette Davis that morning.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to be.
Kelly started her career as a local newspaper reporter in East Kilbride, Scotland before becoming a Scottish correspondent for TV-am in 1984.
She went on to host shows including GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak before launching her eponymous morning programme Lorraine.
She will mark her 35th anniversary with a special show looking back at her most memorable moments and interviews.
The presenter said that "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity" were the secret to longevity in TV, adding: "You have to put in the work.
You have to be honest and authentic.
Do your homework and be both interested and interesting.
Looking back at the news stories that impacted her emotionally, Kelly revealed that reporting on the Dunblane massacre was "very tough."
I had no idea that many of the families whose children had been killed or wounded were watching our live show from Dunblane the day after the horrific killing of sixteen children and their teacher.
One of the mums, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked to see me privately and we ended up talking for hours at her house.
It was all under the radar, I went to Joanna's funeral and Pam and I have been friends ever since.
She added that interviewing Kate and Gerry McCann shortly after their daughter Madeleine went missing in 2007 was "extremely hard" and said that she "really admired their strength and courage."
They have had to put up with the pain of not knowing what has happened to their beloved daughter, as well as the most appalling trolling online.
My heart goes out to them.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary show is on Monday, September 30 from 8.30am on ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga Feared Trapping
Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga turned down an offer by the late president Robert Mugabe to take over the presidency at the height of the coup as he feared it might be a trap to rubberstamp the military take-over in November 2017, a senior government official has claimed.
As reported by the Zimbabwe Independent last week, Mugabe offered Chiwenga to take over the presidency as negotiations between him and the army ensued during the coup.
However, a senior government official said on social media Chiwenga did not turn down the offer out of fear, but he was able to see through Mugabe's plan to use him to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that indeed he had been toppled in a coup.
In a Twitter thread which confirmed Zimbabwe's 37-year-ruler was willing to hand over power to Chiwenga and not President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, whom government officials confirmed was a senior government official in the Office of the President and Cabinet, said intense negotiations were held at the time over the issue.
Government officials said Mugabe approached Chiwenga through one of his emissaries when he realised power was slipping though his hands.
Intercession between the military command element and late former president had three strands, according to the senior government official.
The official said characters involved in the negotiations included presidential spokesperson George Charamba, Central Intelligence Organisation then acting boss Aaron Nhepera and Roman Catholic Bishop cleric Fidelis Mukonori.
Former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Gideon Gono was another strand after he was sent by Mugabe on a one-man mission with the offer of the presidency to Chiwenga who was the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) commander.
The man, who in death more than in life has been described as an African icon, tried in vain to get the AU to denounce the military operation, while seeking intervention by other African leaders.
Offer of presidency to then CDF (Commander Defence Forces Chiwenga) by the late (Mugabe) was not by choice.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation which had grown dangerously fast-paced; wearing down a part of the late's family," the official (Jamwanda) wrote.
But there was also a bit of political baiting which the late hoped would turn the tables, at the very least diplomatically.
Recall that commanders had declared they had not, and would not, overthrow the constitutional order, a development which would have set them on a collision with the AU position on coups.
The late (Mugabe) hoped the then CDF (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, thereby putting paid to claims by commanders they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for (the) late (Mugabe) was that the AU, which by the way was still very confused by the whole situation and how to fit it within its theoretical taxonomy on coups, would then have no option, but to describe it as a coup, in which case calls for military intervention would then have credence.
That was the spirit and calculation within which the offer was made.
Officials said Mugabe made the move when he realised that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to write a resignation letter after the military had warned the strongman that he risked a Gadaffi-style lynching.
Military bosses told him they would not turn their guns on citizens if they marched to his Blue Roof residence.
And at that instant Mugabe had two desires, to save his family and also to prove that the military had taken over power," the official said.
The then CDF and commanders correctly read (the) calculation.
The emissary (Gono) of that desperate message was told -- through a powerful metaphor -- that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the sect of camouflages, that is, the military); we are not politicians or (in) political competition, the senior government official said.
Government officials say the army had communicated to other military bosses in the region through attachés who were in Zimbabwe that their intentions were not to topple Mugabe, but to deal with "criminals" around him.
Mugabe also tried to use the same strategy to lure Mnangagwa back from short exile in South Africa so that they could have a discussion on the coup and succession.
Apart from negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought help from the region.
The South Africans, who were key to the process -- not least because of their economic and regional power, but also because the then president Jacob Zuma was the Sadc chairperson -- refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the army had invaded Mugabe's house, as they were threatening repeatedly in the background, South African troops would have arrived in Harare in no time.
"That did not work because Putin and African leaders did not prefer that route," a source told the Independent.
China needs strong leadership or will 'crumble,' policy paper says
China needs the strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party or the country will "crumble," the government said in a policy paper released on Friday ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
China's cabinet news office said in a white paper that the country's success since the Communists took power 70 years ago was down to the party's leadership.
China is huge in size, has complex national conditions, and its governance difficulties are rarely seen.
Without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move toward division and crumble, bringing disaster to the world," it said.
Chinese authorities have long justified a firm fist in dealing with problems, like the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, as being necessary for national stability.
Strong-arm President Xi Jinping, who will headline the anniversary celebrations of the world's second-biggest economy on Tuesday, has further tightened party rule and cracked down on those who may challenge authority since taking office in late 2012.
Xi has also overseen a military modernization program that has unnerved the region.
China does not seek to export its development model nor want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace and not "hegemony," the policy paper said.
The Chinese people do not have it in their genes to invade others or dominate the world.
In modern times, China has been bullied by the Great Powers, war and turmoil have left a deep impression with the suffering caused; China will never impose the sufferings it has been through on other peoples.
China is marking the anniversary at a time of uncertainty for the country, which is locked in a bitter trade war with the United States and faces challenges from a slowing economy as well as anti-government protests in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.
China will never "trade away" its core interests and not allow its security and sovereignty to be compromised, the paper said.
"The threat of trade wars and the continued increase in tariffs are not conducive to solving problems," it said, in reference to its trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economy with a complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, broad market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never be weakened by trade wars," the paper added.
China is confident that it has the ability to face difficulties, turn crises into opportunities, and open up a new world.
The United States should look rationally at China's development, as China has no intention of challenging the United States and does not want to replace the United States, it added.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more unlikely to stop China's development.
Curbing and suppressing other countries and transferring domestic contradictions abroad will not keep the United States strong.
The world of Jacek Palkiewicz The real face of Dubai
Emirate of Dubai is a place still struggling to find its own identity, torn between the Bedouin tradition, religious Islamic radicalism as well as the extremism of modern times.
This trend-setting leader of modern tourism stimulates imagination and desires, sparks vanity of the rich ones with snobbish hotels and as a tax paradise, draws in investors and salespeople.
Websites spark intensively promote this city of dreams that combines in itself an exciting temple of luxury and an essence of the 21st century architecture.
The emirate founded on petroleum-rich sands soon became a paradise for those who love laps of luxury, five star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools lying hundreds meters above the ground.
Many people are admiring the omnipresent luxury, appreciate the creative hypreractivism and proactive struggle for creating an avant-garde atmosphere.
This is a city whose motto tells us everything: it surprises, it shocks and it enchants.
Almost at every turn.
There are, however, still a few people able to turn a critical eye on Dubai, calling it a city without a soul.
As argued by the British writer, Lawrence Osborne this metropolis, full and contrasts and contradictions, is nothing more than cheap, grotesque city.
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, fully dominated by the Guinness World Records, Emirate's unofficial constitution.
Everything here must be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
Among the jungle of extravagances and lavish luxury, it lacks something that may be not too transparent in the old Europe, but has a great influence on life quality.
In Wroclaw, Berlin or Madrid everyone feels like home.
Unlike in Dubai for sure.
Escaping the world of magic, I took off its golden mask and revealed the second face of this artificial paradise.
The face that you can hardly ever read or hear about.
I am showing the famine of Asian people contrasting with the fairytale-like life led by the divine cast of native Dubai people, the grandchildren of illiterate Bedouins.
I am discovering the jungle of extreme famine, for instance into the ghetto at the outskirts where lots of Asian workmen live in very harsh conditions.
It is them who, as slaves, within one generation's lifetime, managed to build the sky-touching Manhattan right on the desert.
They came here, attracted by good salaries, willing to help their families make a decent living, but what they experienced, is a nightmare.
Tourists will never see it, as that would destroy the myth build over the years.
Since international communities are increasingly expressing their criticism, the issue of cheap workforce is a major nuisance for the emir.
Spice Girls' Mel C bans diet talk at home after eating disorder battle
Spice Girl Melanie Chisholm has admitted diets are banned in her home after her own personal battles with eating disorders which saw her eat nothing but fruit and vegetables for years.
Sporty Spice spent years under-eating and "obsessively exercising" while dealing with the pressures of being in the globally famous pop group and she was later diagnosed with depression as well as an eating disorder.
Now she has revealed that her own experiences affect the way she raises her own daughter, Scarlet and that she doesn't "ever allow people to speak about diets in our house."
"Scarlet's 10 years old now and I'm starting to notice that she's more conscious of the way she looks," said Mel.
But I think one of the positives of having gone through having an eating disorder is that I'm very conscious of how I speak around her.
That positive language - it's habit now.
Speaking to Women's Health magazine, Mel, who shot to fame as part of the Spice Girls in the 1990s, before the rise of social media said that "disgusting" comments about her in the press led to her body issues.
"I started not looking after myself properly, cutting out food groups, and my exercising became more and more obsessive, to the point that I was underweight," she said.
I was unwell and that probably continued for a couple of years."
The photo that shocked the world
A Polish girl and an American documentalist gave the world proof of war cruelty.
The legendary photo by Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of the Second World War in Gdańsk.
"Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and I must speak on behalf of the Polish nation about what has happened here.
America must act and must help!" is how Julien Bryan, a documentalist and photographer, started his radio speech.
In the tragic days of September 1939, he was in the capital city of Poland and witnessed the drama of bombarded city and its residents.
His account has received wide attention in the West.
Initially, the Mayor of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, helped him and lent his car, but later on he asked him to leave the city immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a farewell letter to his family in the USA, deposited it in an embassy safe and... stayed.
Over the next four weeks, he tried to be wherever the Varsovians were.
The city was continuously attacked by 400 planes with the use of artillery.
Bryan's photographs depicted death, distress and fight for survival in the city ruins.
Just before the surrender, together with embassy employees, he smuggled negatives overseas.
He would not stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What has happened to Warsaw will happen to Paris, London and even New York."
First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt watched his shocking footage.
Shortly after, the USA started war preparations.
"My dad showed the truth and that is how he fought against German propaganda.
They made films glorifying their chivalry.
They said they did not attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Trial of ex-athlete accused of multiple rapes goes to jury
Jury deliberations are under way in the rape trial of an ex-university of Delaware baseball player accused of multiple sexual assaults.
Jurors began deliberating the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway on Friday after 10 days of testimony and arguments.
A 21-year-old woman says Conaway raped her after she drove to his house in June 2018.
The encounter happened three weeks after the two connected on the online meeting site Bumble, and he sent her a nude picture of himself.
She is among six women whom Conaway is accused of sexually assaulting between 2013 and 2018.
Prosecutors say the woman objected when consensual cuddling escalated to Conway forcing himself on her.
Defense attorneys have targeted the woman's conflicting accounts and memory lapses and say she may have regretted being physically intimate.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike worth one million PLN
The gold-plated bicycle worth one million PLN was on display at the 10th jubilee edition of the BIKE-EXPO Kielce International Bicycle Trade Show.
It is a unique vehicle printed in a 3D printer.
Its designer, 30-year old Adam Zdanowicz has just received the bicycle Oscar for it at the World Exhibition of Custom Bicycles in Las Vegas.
The unique model was a big hit at the show. "The bike is covered with gold chrome spray, underlaid with silver of the highest quality.
This unique layer has been created by my friend from Żory.
"It has a saddle, pedals, handle bars – you could ride it as any other bike.
It can reach up to 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," explains its designer.
"The bike's bodywork was printed in 3D.
These are cubes creating a type of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model when I was riding my first bicycle home, a few years ago.
I drew it on a piece of paper and hid it deep in my drawer.
The drawing waited five years for execution.
The bike itself took three years to create," adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was excruciatingly difficult to hide all the elements under the bodywork.
It has batteries, cables and elements which create the structure.
All this is hidden under 11 elements of bodywork applied on the steel frame of the bike.
That is where the engine is hidden as well.
The bike's handle bars were manufactured a week before my flight to the United States for the World Bike Exhibition.
I couldn't decide what the handle bars should look like until the very end.
It can be dismantled for transportation.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he sums up.
The gold-plated bike was recognized in Las Vegas in the most important category of "The best amazing individual custom-made model".
Video reveals tourist hotspot as heavily polluted
Surrounded by the Opera House, Circular Quay, Luna Park and of course the iconic Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour is the major contributor to the $21.9 billion Sydney tourism pumps into Australia's economy each year.
But beneath the bridge lies an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous harbour is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, receiving around 15 Olympic-size swimming pools of pollutants each year.
This horrific statistic makes one of our greatest tourism drawcards also one of our dirtiest.
According to a new video, titled Sydney Harbour Above and Below, the waters around Australia's most popular city is filled with cigarette butts, plastic bags and bottles, lost shoes and clothing and even dead animals - all coming into the harbour from stormwater run-off.
But the biggest component choking our waterways is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," Dr Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program said in the video, which was released to coincide with World Tourism Day on September 27.
It does look beautiful, but it is one of the more modified and polluted estuaries along our coastline.
The CSIRO estimates around 1560kg of plastic enters our waterways each hour, most of it coming into the harbour through stormwater drains.
"After we have some of these really big rainfall events, the harbour ... it's quite tragic," Dr Dafforn said.
Two thirds of our pollution comes from stormwater run-off.
But like an iceberg, the problem on Sydney's harbour is far bigger below the surface, with the seabed receiving 70 per cent of plastics that enter the ocean.
"Unless you spend time under the water, I don't think you get a true appreciation of what is below there," Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly said, noting he and his team pull out around 500kg of plastic on their own each year.
I think if more people knew (what was under the water) they would just be horrified.
Overwhelmingly ... over half of everything we find is plastic bags.
The other 50 per cent is at least made out of plastic.
When you look at the harbour it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that we get all of this plastic and all of this rubbish just under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of the Ocean Protect, said there were ways people - both locals and visitors alike - could help to ease the amount of plastic and debris entering our waterways.
"It has to start at the source," he said.
We have to reduce the amount of plastic that we are using, recycle better and be more conscious about what is going down our drains which ultimately ends up in our oceans.
If we ruin the ocean, we are going to kill ourselves because 50 per cent of the oxygen we breathe in comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30 per cent of carbon dioxide and our food source.
But we can fix this harbour and bring it back to where it was, but it's pretty simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The video, which was funded by recycling company TOMRA as part of their broader efforts to educate Australians on protecting the environment and reducing the impact of drink containers that can often end up in nature, coincides with a study about plastic and mental health that was also released this month.
