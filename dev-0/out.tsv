Bosnians protest against Croatia's plans for a radioactive waste disposal facility
On Friday hundreds of people gathered in north-western Bosnia in protest against plans of neighboring Croatia to store part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
The demonstrators in Bosnian town Novi Grad demanded that Croatia abandon its plans to build a landfill site in the former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and declared a fight against the project.
The facility would store waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
The Bosnians, holding banners that read "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - (river) Una needs us," said that the radioactive landfill could endanger the Una River and the lives of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We must say NO,
Miroslav Drljaca, mayor of Novi Grad municipality, told the crowd.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
The Krško power plant located in Slovenia, built in the 1980s, also belongs to Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are to meet next week to discuss additional landfills.
The Croatian public television HRT reported on Friday that it has not yet been decided in Croatia whether to build a landfill site on its own or to pay for storing part of the waste in a new facility built by Slovenia.
The Croatian Minister of Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on each side of the country's ethnic division insisted that Croatia should find a different location in a part of the country closer to the power plant.
"Why does Croatia, with all its territory, claim that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?" - asked Drljac.
We cannot let them humiliate us!

The American Congress has agreed to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
The U.S. Congress for the statutory 15 days after the State Department approved the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multi-purpose fighters did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the purchase negotiations began.
The decision of the Congress, although not unexpected, has great political significance.
"After the approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Defence Policy Advisor to the Washington Conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.
The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the Federal Government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad 15 days before signing a contract, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of selling arms to a NATO member country, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at USD 6.5 billion. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 planes - if this transaction is finally completed - will be the American armaments company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the F-35A fighter engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney.
Proposals to purchase the fifth generation F-35 American fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted in May by Minister of Defense Mariusz Błaszczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during a meeting between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump at the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if it is finalized, will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon within the framework of the Foreign Military Sales Program (FMS).
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired, among others, the Patriot anti-missile system.
The price of one F-35 fighter was about 89.2 million dollars without weapons and technical assistance at the time of the Polish bid.
As American military experts who wished to remain anonymous informed the PAP, such a price given in the preliminary negotiations was "the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"Prices are falling sharply, currently the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, much less than Eurofighter, which does not have the advantages of F-35," Venable pointed out.
PAP's interlocutors expressed their hope that the final negotiations on the purchase of American fighter planes by Poland will be completed this year.
Possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction - i.e. offset - will be discussed directly with American F-35 fighter manufacturers.
What is the Münchhausen replacement band referred to in the series "Payton Hobart Elections" on the Netflix platform?
Guardians and parents with the above mentioned disorder pretend that their healthy child is sick.
The series "Payton Hobert's Choices" will be launched on the Netflix platform today.
It tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first has to become president of the student council in his high school.
In the series Ryan Murphy, creator of "American Horror Story" and "Glee", we will see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, it addresses the subject of Münchhausen's replacement syndrome - a mental illness that occurs in carers who act as if the healthy person they are dealing with were affected by a physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, e.g. Münchhausen's syndrome, which causes symptoms of the disease.
Münchhausen's replacement team simulates that the person in our care has certain ailments.
It is also called an imaginary and induced disease, and is treated as violence against the child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves a parent exaggerating or causing symptoms so that it looks like their child is sick.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen's replacement syndrome?
Symptoms of this disease may vary, but the NHS notes the following examples of behaviour:
Persuading the medical personnel that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Exaggerating or inventing symptoms.
Falsifying the results so that the child is considered sick, e.g. giving glucose to urine samples to make it look like the child has diabetes.
Causing symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often does Münchhausen's replacement band perform?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases are not reported.
A study published in 2000 indicates that there have been 89 cases of this disorder per 100,000 people in over two years.
What should be done if there are suspicions that the child may be in danger?

Nigeria: Police raid on Kaduna school, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna - The state police station in Kaduna yesterday conducted a raid on the Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal school in Layin Maidubun Tsumma in Rigas, Igabi Municipality Area, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were in highly dehumanized conditions. The school authorities deny this claim.
A resident claiming to be Shehu, a preacher at school, said: "They are not telling the truth because all the children were there with their parents' consent.
Before accepting children to school, parents signed the form.
Parents brought food to their children every day and knew what conditions they were in.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of all of the students' food delivered by their parents before the school was closed.
This is not right, because parents can testify whether their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the previous Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of childcare, never had any objections.
He claimed that children study the Koran and nothing else.
However, Yakubu Sabo, a public relations officer at the police station, decided that the children would join their parents after the state was handed over to the government.
"They were kept in dehumanizing conditions in the name of surrendering or acquiring coranic knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their back, which proves that they were beaten.
That's why we're researching the school to get to know its owner", he added.
Foreign talent important for China's development
Guangdong is the country's leader in attracting foreign talent largely due to the Belt and Trail Initiative (BRI), the Great Gulf Area (GBA) of Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao and Shenzhen's new role as a pilot demonstration area.
The Nanfang Media Group has interviewed seven expatriates aged 10 to 70 in Guangdong.
A Singaporean native, Yash, born in 2010 during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou said he would like to fulfill his dream of becoming a scientist and doing his doctorate in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrov, a Russian student of the Russian-Chinese university Shenzhen MSU-BIT said: "Thanks to the BRI initiative, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
Together we can create new concepts and new ventures.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the USA started her career as a beauty blogger in Dongguan and has over a million fans in Bilibili and Weibo.
She said that she will continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology in her videos.
Leticia de Lassus from France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI in Guangzhou, agrees that "educating children is like fastening a jacket.
If you button up the first button incorrectly, the rest will never get to the right place.
An American of Chinese origin, Henry Xiao believes that at the heart of the GBA, his company can enjoy many privileges with regard to new rules, government policies and capital resources, especially talent.
The culinary producer of "Nanta Show" Sean Choi from South Korea said that the cuisine of the Guangdong region is known all over the world and the introduction of "Nanta Show" in Guangdong was a good decision.
Stephan Mohler from Switzerland as technical director of quality at Pearl River Pianos believes that the secret of quality lies in the correct execution of simple work.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China like to work, learn to make good products and persistently strive for better results.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
"I believe that Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda," believes Tomasz Siemoniak.
Tomasz Siemoniak, Vice President of Civic Platform, spoke to Polsat News about the affair involving the head of NIK.
"This case is disqualifying for Marian Banaś.
He can become the Minister of Culture for some entertainment, not the head of NIK or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone who is responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Siemoniak also spoke about the candidacy of Klaudia Jachira.
"Antoni Macierewicz is on the Law and Justice lists.
A man who not only said things, but did them.
He accused the former heads of the SKW of spying on Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why does nobody call for Antoni Macierewicz not to be on the lists?", he asked.
"People younger than us have a different aesthetic.
I think that Jachira, who has already apologized for one of the things, also feels that she sometimes exaggerates.
Let's not make this a campaign problem", he added.
Tourists after the collapse of the Neckermann Poland travel agency are coming back to Poland on schedule
According to the office, there was no need to bring tourists before time.
"The office successively pays for unpaid hotel accommodation from the insurance guarantee," it says.
On September 25th Neckermann Poland travel agency filed a declaration of insolvency with the Marshal's Office.
At the time of the declaration of insolvency by the office, there were 3600 tourists outside the country.

Tourists will fly to Katowice and Warsaw (five charter flights in total).
Some of them will return on scheduled flights.
During the weekend - as planned - about 1000 tourists staying on vacation in Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy should return to the country.
According to the information provided by the Marshal's Office of the Mazowieckie Province, the travel agency sold about 20 thousand trips for the autumn-winter season.
"These clients of the travel agency should contact the insurer - Allianz Partners directly", the office recalled.
He also added that "the situation of tourists who signaled problems in the hotels seems to be stabilized for the moment, and the emerging incidents of tourists being asked to leave the hotels have been alleviated together with the consular services".
Last Friday, the authorities of the largest and oldest travel agency, Thomas Cook, reported that it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH owned 100 percent of Neckermann Polska.
The "Dreadful" masked child rapist from the Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a camouflage suit, the man grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into dense bushes in the Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was executed in his house, where the officers detained a number of items essential for the investigation.
The man confessed his guilt with regard to seven charges related to the attack and three more concerning the seduction and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along the path, and when she looked back, she saw him suddenly come out of the bushes armed with a large branch and knife.
When she begged "stop, stop, stop", he grabbed her by the neck and forced her into the bushes.
The man said: "Quiet, don't shout.
Don't shout, or I'll have to hurt you.
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her arms and legs with cable ties, and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work around 9.30 a.m. without answering a few SMS and calls from colleagues.
His clothing was dirty and wore traces of grass and tree, and he claimed to have been involved in an accident related to a rage attack on the road where he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the mound.
The trial of the man's conviction will continue on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats, and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement is threatening to increase social inequalities if it does not consider the common good from an ethical point of view.
Pope Francis gave these words at a conference at the Vatican, attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethicists.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered the participants at the conference entitled "The future of the Catholic Church. "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest proof that the Vatican is interested in participating in the debate on the prospects and threats of artificial intelligence.
The discussion focused on technological developments in the art of war and the future of work, in connection with which machines will play an increasingly important role, as well as a case study investigating the Christchurch assassination attempt in New Zealand and the decisions made by social media companies in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution saved workers from dangerous and monotonous work.
He warned, however, that the increasing dependence on robotic devices for profit is a risk of depriving people of their dignity resulting from work.
"If technological progress were to become the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to undesirable backwardness to some kind of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
The organizers of the conference expressed their hope to use the expertise of the participants and to identify possible future advisors of the Catholic Church on high technology issues.
Martin Odegaard, a player borrowed from Real Madrid, makes fans euphoric with his impressive assistance.
Martin Odegaard noted an impressive assistant on Mikela Oyarzabala's opening goal.
Winning 2:0 against Osasuna, Real Madrid has climbed to the top of the La League table and continues the streak of being invincible on its own court this year.
However, despite not having failed a single one-time loss this season at La Liga Zinedine Zidane is under enormous pressure due to a turbulent preseason period and a public quarrel with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The situation reached boiling point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the Champions League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid have real talents at their disposal - the Frenchman has plans for some of them, for others not.
Vinícius Júnior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and currently plays in a band.
However, it was Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was hired to Real Sociedad, who caused a great stir, counting the unbelievable assistance in the La League match.
During the meeting of Real Sociedad with Alaves Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Mikel Oyarzabala and Real Sociedad finally won 3:0 in front of his own audience.
After picking up the ball from the right, Martin Odegaard emancipated a player from the other team by putting a net on him and then sent an incredible pass by inches between two other players and his teammate.
The second goal by Willian Jose and the third by the amazing Oyarzabal, this time from the penalty kick, ensured a decisive victory for Imanola's charges before Manu Garcia was sent off the field five minutes before the game was over.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid only as a 16 year old in 2015, but he had difficulties trying to meet the expectations of his fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel confident on the pitch.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of Sharad Pawar's name in the case of a fraud involving the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra
Anna Hazare declared: "Sharad Pawar's name was not on the list when the case was brought to me.
Social activist Anna Hazare was not surprised by the fact that the name of Sharad Pawar - President of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP - appeared in connection with a multi-million dollar fraud at the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank.
The Investigation Agency of the Executive Directorate, ED for short, has filed a case against Sharad Pawarov, his nephew Ajit Pawarov - former Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra - and others for fraud.
The information report of the Executive Directorate on the case, equivalent to the FIR police report, was submitted by the central agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on a report by the FIR of the Mumbai police, which lists the names of former bank president, Ajit Pawar, and 70 former employees of a financial institution.
When the case came to me, Sharad Pawar's name was nowhere to be found.
"How did his name come up, whoever gave it, only they know these things," Anna Hazare said on Thursday when he was asked about the ED case and Sharad Pawar's alleged connection to the fraud.
Anna Hazare, a critic of Sharada Pawara, expressed hope that the truth will come to light as a result of ED's thorough investigation of the fraud.
"ED will find out where his name came from in the case," said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in a demonstration against corruption.
Sharad Pawar denies committing a criminal act and claims that he was in no way affiliated with the bank, and questions the fact that the case was reported a few weeks before the October 21 election of the Maharasht Assembly.
The former Minister of the Union assured that he would not yield to the majesty of Delhi, referring explicitly to the central government led by the BJP party.
The NCP assessed the case of the Executive Directorate as politically motivated.
Busy day at SG.
Yesterday several smugglers did not manage to export to Ukraine the stolen items worth over 130 thousand zlotys.
All the events were recorded yesterday (September 26th) on the way out of Poland.
In Korczowa, a Romanian citizen was carrying a Specialized electric bicycle.
The Border Guard officers, in determining the legality of the object's origin, contacted representatives of the German Police and quickly established that a modern single track worth about 10 thousand zlotys was stolen on the territory of that country.
A few hours later, also in Korczowa, border guards controlling a semitrailer registered in France found an interference in the VIN numbering field.

The value of the vehicle transported on a trailer was estimated at 75 thousand PLN.
The driver of the set was a 32-year-old Ukrainian citizen.
The Border Guard confirmed that just two weeks ago, the quad was lost on Polish territory and is being sought after throughout Europe.
A "partial" attempt to export the stolen vehicle was also thwarted in Medyka.
A 41-year-old Ukrainian traveling by bus was carrying body parts from an exclusive Mercedes.
All identification marks on the parts were mechanically removed.
The body parts worth about 15 thousand zlotys were retained.

Mylan agrees to pay $30 million under the EpiPen settlement
Mylan has agreed to pay $30 million as part of a settlement for failure to notify investors of the Department of Justice's investigation into a possible claim for an excessive amount in Medicaid for EpiPen.
The Securities and Exchange Commission stated on Friday that Mylan NV qualified EpiPen for "generic" drugs in the Medicaid reimbursement program.
As a result, the pharmaceutical company gave the government a much lower return on part of the product price than if EpiPen was classified as a "branded" drug.
In July, Mylan revealed that it had reached an agreement on principles with KPWiG on this issue.
In its Friday's statement, the company stated that it neither confirms nor denies the charges of KPWiG.
Is this God's punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, child death.
These are dramas that cause a lot of suffering and are difficult to understand.
We ask: "Why"?
Sometimes we also hear that "God wanted this".
Is it the Creator who sends us misery and disease?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujicicic was born 36 years ago, his dad ran out of the room in horror.
"My son has no arms or legs!", he shouted to the doctor.
The parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that deprived them of limbs.
At first they could not accept the boy.
But they prayed and after four months, Nick's mother felt that God has a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujicic is a world-renowned evangelizer and motivational speaker who converts many people.
"I'm proof that God is never wrong," Nick stresses.
"When suffering affects us, it is difficult to understand.
We look for reasons.
We ask: "Why did this happen to us?"
If we believe that God has control over the whole world and directs our lives, the question naturally arises as to whether it was He who sent us illness, misery...".
The mother confesses to the murder of two teenage sons
The woman broke out crying when she was told she could spend the rest of her life in prison after she confessed to murdering two of her teenage sons and planning to kill the other four of her children.
Sarah Barrass, 35, confessed to the murder of Tristan Barrass (13 years old) and Blake Barrass (14 years old).

The crimes you have committed speak for themselves.
Murder of two children.
Attempted murder of four children and the whole conspiracy to take their lives.
I am practically convinced that each of you will be sentenced to life imprisonment several times in due time.
The judge will determine whether it will be a punishment of absolute imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
The verdict will be issued on November 12th.
MEP PO Krzysztof Brejza sues Cezary Gmyz
"I am suing Cezary Gmyz in connection with the TV writer's campaign of lies," said PO MEP Krzysztof Brejza on Twitter.
The reason for the lawsuit is the statement of the publicist Cezary Gmyz in the program "Gone 20" on TVP.
One of the leading people in charge of SokiemzBurak is Krzysztof Brejza, who has extensive experience in organizing the hate department.
"The people who know Mariusz Kozak-Zagoza - the founder of the "heyter" profile - are Kierwiński, Budka and Giertych", said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka are websites and social profiles with memes and jokes related to politics.
According to "Sieci", behind the profile of this title is PR officer Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda.

Boris Johnson referred to the police supervisory authority for her close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The IOPC Independent Police Proceedings Authority will investigate whether the Prime Minister has been abused as a criminal offence during his public office as Mayor of London.
The Council of Greater London (GLA) made a statement that its Supervisor had registered a "case related issue" with the Prime Minister on accusations of preferential treatment of Arcuri due to their close acquaintance.
"A "question of conduct" can be discussed when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
This does not mean that it has been proven in any way.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate the case.
The issue was referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of the police force in England and Wales.
It was transferred to this police authority because Johnson was the equivalent of a police commissioner and a criminal commissioner.
Johnson denied that there were any irregularities due to his close relationship with Arcuri.
Earlier he said he would follow the London City Council's order and give details of his relationship with Arcuri, but he insisted that the council "was focusing on the wrong problem".
The injunction follows a report by The Sunday Times that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven years ago, received £126,000 of budget money, as well as privileged access to three overseas trade missions headed by the then-champion of Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government froze a grant of £100,000 to Hacker House, a company owned by Arcuri, until the case is resolved.
The government will have troublesome questions about the verification procedure carried out before the funds are granted.
Digitization Minister Matt Warman said in the House of Commons that the employees of his department have "customarily exercised due diligence" and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, calls to the number were redirected to an office in California, where 34-year-old Arcuri is now to live.
The Prime Minister's close relationship with the businesswoman "was a secret of the polisinyl's secret for the staff.
The GLA's decision to refer the Prime Minister's case to the IOPC's independent police investigation office was met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to a source from a senior government representative, it is a "politically motivated attack" and its timing - on the eve of the Conservative Party conference - is "overtly political.
"The Supervisor did not provide any evidence to support the allegations, and neither did the Prime Minister get a chance to answer him before the press release was published late on Friday evening," the source says.
Neither citizens nor the media will be fooled by such an overtly political bill.
Today, in earlier hours, the journalists of "The Standard" were told that Johnson's close relationship with a businesswoman from California, who is assisted by an agency for tourism and promotion in London, was a "polisinyl secret" for employees.
Former London Partners (LP) employees reminded the agency that Arcuri was given seats on Johnson's overseas business trips as mayor despite the fact that her companies were not considered "credible" at the time.
Third accused of drug crimes in connection with the death of Mac Miller
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A third man was arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with last year's death of rapper Mac Miller due to a drug overdose.
According to court records, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit fentanyl-treated oxycodone pills that Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a powerful opioid responsible for the "epidemic" that claimed several thousand lives in the United States.
Walter is accused of delivering the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Court documents unsealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit was receiving drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected of being Walter's "courier" who supplied Pettit with the pills.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defence in their case.
Walter, who was on parole in the 2005 drugs case, is in custody, and has already been sentenced to five months' imprisonment for violating the conditions of his release.
Prosecutors who are dealing with the case first reported on Thursday on the TMZ celebrity website are demanding that Walter remain in custody pending trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the accused escaping.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine did not come immediately.
Pettit was charged in the federal court on September 4 and his lawyer refused to comment.
The lyrics of Miller's rhymed songs are an honest conversation about his depression and drug use, which has earned him fans among the biggest hip-hop stars.
A native of Pittsburgh, Miller, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, had a relationship with singer Ariana Grande for two years, previously completed in 2018.
After his death, she published a moving film with Miller and the song "Thank U Next" on the Instagram portal.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked in recent years with the abuse of opioids.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of an overdose in 2016, and the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone was found in his body.
This article has been changed: the correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen," not "Steven.
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games for mobile devices
The 9-year-old creates a fun game of hide and seek with the free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has used it to generate more than 30 games for mobile devices.
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player scores a point every time he catches a bat that comes out of the hideout.
I learned how to create games on a fast track course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad enrolled him in a five-day accelerated course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, was aimed at providing children like Basil with access to new technologies like robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
"When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in creating games increased when he was 7 years old and he was given a board for devoting all his time to games.
"One day he was playing on a tablet, as usual, and was so absorbed by it that I got nervous," said father.
Out of anger, I said, "You're still just playing, can't you think about creating your own games so others can play them?
Speaking these words, I was nervous and didn't think he would take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has been actively interested in learning how to create his own games, and he encouraged his parents to buy a laptop and sign it up for a course where he learned the basics of creating games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his games titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population takes the lead in innovation on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds have been celebrated for using codes to create robots to separate their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from a high school for women in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 contest for programming robots for stacking boxes.
And thanks to the growing investments of technology giants like Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and his peers are well on their way to becoming coding stars.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit to lying about corruption
According to court documents filed on Friday, the former president of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating corruption of the main political donor.
According to the wokanda, Robin Hayes is to confess next Wednesday.
A factual basis document, prepared as part of a defense settlement and signed by Hayes' lawyer, shows that Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defense settlement was sealed, and there is no factual basis on which Hayes will confess.
Initially, he was accused of collusion, corruption and giving false testimony.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in an insurance company's government plan to make campaign contributions to the country's main insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates have been accused of attempting to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment company, and in recent years has been one of the main political donors in the state, having donated over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He mainly supported the goals and politicians of the Republican Party, but he also made donations to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not reply to Friday's email asking for a comment.
Hayes Kearns Davis' defense attorney did not respond to Friday's email asking for comments.
According to court documents filed on Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he hadn't talked to Causey about employees of the State Department of Insurance.
According to the factsheet, Hayes actually talked to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request to make changes to the staff employed by the market regulator.
The accusers claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg to arrange a meeting with Causey and that he talked about the bribe directly to the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment for his insurance business and planned to donate up to $2 million for Causeya's renewed campaign in 2020.
The indictment also states that the conspiracy also demanded a change of department official who controlled Lindberg.
As a Republican, Causey reported the alleged attempted corruption to federal agents and helped them gather evidence in the case.
He was not charged.
According to the indictment, Lindberg's accomplice ordered Hayes to donate $250,000 to Causey's campaign during a conversation in which Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that giving such an amount of money would attract attention, but, according to the accusation, he eventually resigned.
"Whatever you all want to do, we'll do it." - According to the indictment, Hayes said.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The spokeswoman of the Federal Prosecutor did not respond to an e-mail asking for further information on the settlement.
Drivers will drive the first section of the new zakopianka
From Saturday, drivers will be able to use the first of the three mountain sections of the S7 expressway under construction, i.e. the new Zakopianka - from Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdrój and further on the dual carriageway main road accelerated to Chabówka.
As Iwona Mikrut, spokeswoman of the Krakow branch of the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA), informed on Friday, this is the first of three sections of the S7 under construction south of Krakow, from Lubin to Rabka Zdroj, which will be put into operation.
From the over 6-kilometre-long section from Skomielna Biała to Chabówka more than one third, that is approx.
2.3 km, it was led on viaducts.
Seventeen of them were built, including the longest and highest, one kilometer long and 50 m high, and four small objects on watercourses at the Skomielna junction.
From this junction there were exits to Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, to national road No. 28 and to the old DK7.
From the next junction, Zabornia, you can take the DK47 in the direction of Nowy Targ and Zakopane and the DK7 to Chyżne and the state border with Slovakia.
On Zbojecka Góra, a place for ILO travelers was established.
The expressway ends at the Zabornia junction in Rabka Zdroj, to which a kilometer-long dual carriageway section DK47 was added to Chabówka and there it was incorporated into the existing dual carriageway Chabówka - Rdzawka.
The S7 section of Skomielna Biała - Radka Zdrój and a new section of the national road No. 47 of the main accelerated class (GP) from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka was built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment was about 615 million PLN.
The guarantee of the quality of the works will be valid for 10 years.
A fragment of the new Zakopianka, about 16.7 km long, including 15.8 km with parameters of an expressway, was divided into three implementation sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubien - Naprawa, Naprawa - Skomielna Biała and Skomielna Biała - Rabka Zdrój.
The first section to enter the tunnel is performed by the Polish-Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the tunnel section is performed by the Italian company Astaldi and the third by the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is nearly 2.5 billion PLN.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is over 1.3 billion PLN.
A total of 38 engineering structures (bridges, viaducts, flyovers) and a two-chamber tunnel with a length of 2.06 km are being built along this entire section.
According to the announcement of the road manager, still this year a 7.6 km long section Lubien - Repair with temporary incorporation into the old DK7 will be made available, which drivers will bypass the tunnel construction.
The last section, Naprawa - Skomielna Biała, about 3 km long, will be driven in 2021, after completion of the construction of a two-chamber tunnel with a length of each line of about 2.06 km.
Our goal is a welfare state
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland," said Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to persuade to vote for Councillor Dariusz Matecki, a candidate to the Sejm from the Law and Justice list.
"The program of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the welfare state", said the minister.
"We want Poles to earn much better, so that their lives are on a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland and we cannot afford it.
Our government has been carrying out a program for four years, which it committed to do four years ago.
We said we would introduce the 500 plus program.
Platform, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopcz said that it is impossible, that this money simply does not exist.
We proved that there is and there was money, only the PO did not care about those to whom it was supposed to go".
Ziobro also reminded about the children's trip and the thirteenth pension - and that a fourteenth pension is also planned.
In addition to the "prudent distribution of national income", the priorities of the Law and Justice party are a fair state and economic development.
Money shouldn't just go into the pockets of the chosen ones, who have good relations with the establishment and the authorities, but should evenly reach the whole society - said the politician.

Facebook will hide the likes and dislikes counter for a test
As part of an experiment conducted for the first time in the world to improve the well-being of users, some of those who use Facebook will soon see no counter of likes, reactions and video displays under the posts of others.
Favorites will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be implemented in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version initiated this Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, Director of Facebook Privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a wellness survey and the opinions of mental health professionals indicating that the Flik Counter may encourage comparisons with others.
"The response from the many harassment groups and mental health organizations working with us was really positive," Garlick said.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of content, not on the number of likes and dislikes.
It is expected that sharing through the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be perceived as competition," she said.
Garlick has assured that companies that base their Facebook operations will continue to receive the same indicators and observations to which they have had access so far.
She stated that it is too early to say whether the test will be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland were included.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be implemented permanently.
"Initial comments from users on the new Instagram rules were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening," she said.
Commenting on the site of the world's experiment, Garlick said that Australia has a very active, technically familiar Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that will provide us with authoritative feedback on whether or not a new experience is valuable to those using our services.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims from the curia
The Czestochowa curia has not yet commented on the councilors' appeal to the local metropolitan Archbishop Waclaw Depo to provide financial compensation for waste management during the pilgrimage season.
The town applies for 1 PLN from the pilgrim.
On Friday he spoke to the Metropolitan at a press conference attended by the leader of Spring Robert Biedroń, organized on Częstochowa's avenue of the Blessed Virgin Mary leading towards Jasna Góra, the vice-president of the local city council and a candidate to the Seym, Łukasz Kot.
The cat informed that the day before, the local SLD councillors had voted an appeal to Archbishop Wacław Depo to give the town one zloty from each pilgrim visiting Częstochowa - to support the work of municipal and municipal services, etc.
We accepted the appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, to help us clean up after the pilgrims, to prepare the city for the pilgrims.
"Please transfer a symbolic zloty from each pilgrim to the city budget.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide them with better conditions for their stay in Częstochowa", said the vice president of the city council.
The spokesperson of the Częstochowa metropolitan curia, Fr. Mariusz Bakalarz, asked for a commentary, initially prepared a few sentences' answer, but then asked - as he signaled, on the order of Archbishop Depo - to replace it with information about the content: "Until we receive the official position of the city council, we do not refer to the matter".
According to the project published on the website of the Częstochowa magistrate, the appeal to Archbishop Depo concerns "the transfer of financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season".
"In connection with the growing number of pilgrims coming to Czestochowa and the increasing costs of servicing the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, bearing in mind the image of the city among the inhabitants, pilgrims and pilgrims, we would like to propose, within the framework of the generally accepted canons of taking care of our common good, the small homeland of Czestochowa, to participate in the costs of servicing the aforementioned waste management system", sounds a fragment of the appeal.
"In order to maintain the cleanliness of the walking and driving routes used by the pilgrims, while at the same time using small infrastructure, i.e. external waste baskets, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of 1 zloty from the pilgrim", wrote.
"Additionally, in connection with participation in the annual costs which the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the cleanliness and aesthetics of the urban space, and wanting to emphasize that such cooperation will bring benefits to all parties, we declare that 20 percent of the above mentioned amount will be allocated to improving the tourist infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of publicly accessible public toilets", declared the councilors.
They pointed out that, apart from financial issues, their proposal resulted from numerous objections raised by the residents as to the cleanliness of the routes the pilgrims travel on.
"Bearing in mind the care for the cleanliness of our city and the possibly positive effects of cooperation, the Częstochowa City Council appeals to the Metropolitan Archbishop of Częstochowa, Wacław Depo, to provide financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for servicing the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season", was repeated in the appeal.
According to the press office of Jasna Gora, 834 thousand people participated in 200 national pilgrimages to this sanctuary last year.
About 124 thousand of the faithful came in 255 walking pilgrimages.
More than 8.8 thousand people came to Czestochowa on bicycle pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 people (16 groups) on cross-country skiing pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the sanctuary on horseback and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups - on skates.
TVP "News" omitted the Confederacy when describing the survey
According to a survey conducted by Pollster, in the elections to the Law and Justice (PiS) Sejm he would gain 45 percent of votes, KO 26 percent, Left 14 percent, PSL 7 percent, and Confederation 5 percent.
The information about crossing the election threshold was even written on the "Super Express" portal, for which the poll was conducted.
In the main edition of "News", describing the same survey, the results of only the first four parties were presented, completely omitting the Confederacy.
The leader, Edyta Lewandowska, clearly emphasized that only four committees have crossed the electoral threshold and would enter the Parliament.
TVP's viewers were also shown the division of parliamentary seats without considering the votes cast for the Confederation.
This would give PiS an independent government.
In his commentary on the whole situation, Krzysztof Bosak spoke of "public disgrace in the matter of honesty towards society".
"They started with slogans about the "moral revolution,"" he recalled and stated that this issue was a sign of a sense of weakness.
Robert Winnicki, in turn, wrote on Twitter that "TVP news" in subsequent actions against the Confederation embarrass Urban and Michnik.
He also drew attention to the lack of reaction from right-wing journalists.
"But let us also look at those who keep quiet.
Those "righteous", "independent", "unrelenting".
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of all that they were said to have fought against," he added.

Brother sentenced to life imprisonment for the honor killing of social media star Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos published on social networking sites, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most famous "honour killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfs - polite by Western standards but considered provocative in a strongly misogynistic Pakistan - was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that he had no remorse for his actions and declared that he had "obviously" murdered his sister and that her behavior was "unacceptable.
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that a court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits) will be acquitted by a higher court. - he said.
Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, had previously told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent.
This was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
The murder of Baloch has been placed at the forefront of the world's news services and has resumed calls for action against the epidemic of so-called honor killings, in which victims - usually women - are killed for violating patriarchal social principles.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or daggered for such offenses as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing "shame" to their families by manifesting their own sexuality.
The murders are usually performed by a close relative.
Under Pakistani law, Qisas (bloody money) and Diyat (retaliation) can ask for forgiveness from their closest victims.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, the Parliament adopted new legislation introducing life imprisonment for honor killings.
However, whether a murder is considered an honorary offence is left to the discretion of the judge, which means that murderers can theoretically invoke another motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially insisted that their son should not be shown any mercy.
However, crushed by the thought that they might lose him too, they changed their minds and declared that they wanted his acquittal.
The international outrage caused by the murder prompted the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself an heir with its parents, forcing it to move forward.
One of Baloch's most famous achievements is offering to strip in front of the Pakistani cricket team and wearing a dressed purple dress on Valentine's Day.
She has been criticized and threatened, but many people, including the young, saw her as a breakingthrough in a country where posing as a Kim Kardashian model figure can be considered a bold and political movement to empower women.
The roots of "honorable" killing lie in the tribal social norms that still prevail in South Asia and, in particular, norms of women's behavior, although men can also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced people from north-western Nigeria to 40 thousand: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN organization reported that the increasing violence has doubled the number of people displaced from northwestern Nigeria to about 40,000 over the past four months.
The UN refugee agency said that the unrest has created a "new humanitarian emergency" that requires an inter-agency effort to raise new funds of $35.5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamist grouping Boko Haram, which has been leading the uprising in the north of the country for a decade, is not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsin observed over the last 10 months is rather the result of the activities of organized armed groups.
"This paints a terrifying picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He informed about frequent reports of kidnappings, torture, extortion, murder and sexual assault by attackers who also destroy houses and steal property.
The army and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the army is being pulled away from the fighting with Boko Haram and a branch of the Islamic State in West Africa, which separated from its former grouping in 2016.
"Refugees do not come with the names of the groups," he said.
But they come with terrible stories.
Refugees mostly get to neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that he expected more people to flee to Niger in the coming months with the deteriorating security situation, especially in the state of Sokoto-san.
A new trial date was set for a man accused of killing a woman and 2 children
A new trial date has been scheduled for a Guatemalan male accused of killing a Guatemalan resident of Iowa and her two children.
According to the files of the District Court in Polk County, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders under a false name that the authorities claim was originally given to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He did not plead guilty.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son deadly on July 16th at their home in Des Moines.
The court records show that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give the representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs officials claim that Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010 he was sentenced for illegal entry to the USA.
"The Sun." Boris Johnson in the face of a rebellion by the Cabinet to lower demands on brexit and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final EU leaders' summit, fears are growing among the most important people in the country around the Prime Minister that he will not have enough time to make major concessions.
Boris Johnson faces the risk of a rebellion by the Cabinet to lower demands for brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
There was an impasse in the negotiations on a new customs system to replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels described the proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "impracticable".
The Crown ministers expect EU decision-makers headed by German boss Angela Merkel to offer the criticized Tory leader a last-minute compromise in the form of a three-year time limit for the backstop mechanism.  
The Sun" journalists talked to three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual Tory Conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close advisor Dominik Cummings of trying to bluff the EU and threatening to leave the EU without an agreement and then accept the last-minute offer made by the EU.
One of the Cabinet Ministers described the devastating verdict of the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday to end the suspension of parliament as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way for us to leave the European Union on October 31st is by agreement.
We will never overcome the arithmetic in the House of Commons, which works against us.
The Prime Minister must now bend over and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggressiveness does not pay off: it is obvious that Cummings' plan burned to the ground.
We cannot fight battles on so many fronts.
The other cabinet minister undertook to tell Johnson to try to push through the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else fails.
This minister said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to present the agreement proposed by Theresa May to the House of Commons again.
There are many chances to vote for it, and everyone is very keen to end this topic.
If we are forced to extend the deadline, it is the end of Boris Johnson and the end of us all.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
In a biting speech the first minister on behalf of the Tory said: "The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he wrestles with the bulls in Scotland, checks the eggs in Wales and argues with citizens on the main city streets - all in front of the world, as if the election campaign was already underway for good.
A spokesman for the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement is still a long way off, and added: "No one should have any illusions: there is a very long way to go to secure an agreement.
However, the spokesman also said that Benn's law implementing the postponement of brexit by three months if no agreement is reached "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work.
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today to have more discussions with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will be discussing a book on how the food and living zone works for the whole of Ireland.
A dog without a nose and leg conquers Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
The cunnery was to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to Great Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with an animal at first sight.
"At first I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt, because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman has decided to take care of the bitch until someone else adopts her.
However, there was still no one to report.
"The fact that nobody wanted it made me want to take care of it more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," she told Kate.
Finally, the couple decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly perfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, that's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Over time, Bonnie has become a social media star.
More than 14 thousand Internet users observe it on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a Glasgow accent I would never make a career in television
According to Lorraine Kelly, the TV bosses said that due to an accent from Glasgow "will never make a career" as a presenter.
Recalling her 35-year career in the television industry, Kelly, 59, admitted that before her first appearance on the screen, she felt "very upset".
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at the BBC Scotland as a search and checker specialist, the boss said I would never be successful on TV because of my accent in Glasgow.
I went to London to meet the entire TV-am team and watch the show before I took over from the Glasgow office.
I will never forget the interview with Bette Davis star conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I did not believe that I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV-am correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then started running programs such as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak", and then started with her morning program "Lorraine", which he named after her.
The 35th anniversary of her career will be celebrated with a special program during which she will recall her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long TV internship is "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity", she added: "You have to work hard.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for the programs and be both interested and interesting.
When she recalls media reports that moved her emotions, Kelly reveals that it was "very difficult" for her to report on the attack on Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families of killed or wounded children were watching our show live from Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teacher.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked for hours at her house.
The whole meeting was held quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, in which I participated.
She added that it was "extremely difficult" to interview Kate and Gerry McCann shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that she "really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition, they have to endure the most horrible comments of Internet trolls.
I am with them with all my heart.
The program to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on television will begin at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30 at ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga feared imprisonment
A senior civil servant claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga rejected the offer to take over the office of President made by the late President Robert Mugabe at the height of the coup because he feared imprisonment to confirm the military takeover in November 2017.
As reported by "The Zimbabwe Independent" last week, Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenga to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military as part of the coup.
However, a senior government official announced in the social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer out of fear, but because he reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he actually lost in the coup.
In a Twitter thread that confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to hand over power to Vice President Chiwenga and not to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, who was confirmed by government officials as a senior government official in the Office of the President and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that intensive negotiations were underway at the time.
Government officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that power was getting out of hand.
The mediation between the military authorities and the deceased former president had, in the opinion of a senior government official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations was the spokesperson of President George Charamba, the then head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper and a clergyman representing the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was another element since Mugabe sent him on a one-man mission to pass on the presidency's offer to Chiwenga, who was head of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (SOZ).
A man who, after his death, was considered an icon of Africa even more than he was alive, tried in vain to get the AU to condemn military action, trying to get other African leaders to intervene.
The offer of the president, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to Chiwenga's then Chief of Defense Forces (SSO), was not a choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that had gained dangerously fast pace, removing part of the family of the deceased," wrote the official (Jamwanda).
But there was also some political temptation with which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-diplomatic way.
It is enough to remember that the commanders declared that they did not and will not overthrow the constitutional order, which would be the reason for their conflict with the AU position on the subversion.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that the SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait at that time, violently interrupting the leaders' claims that they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the AU, which, by the way, was still highly confused by the whole situation and the way it fit into its theoretical taxonomy of subversion, would have no choice but to describe it as a subversion and therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit and with such a respectfulness that this offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defense forces were no longer willing to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the strongman that he was risking lynching in Gaddafi's style.
The army chiefs told him that they would not return the rifles against the citizens if they moved to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires, namely to save his family and to prove that the army had taken over," the official added.
The then SSO and commanders read the assumptions correctly.
The envoy (Gono) carrying this desperate message was made to understand - through a powerful metaphor - that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to a camouflage sect, i.e., the army), we are not politicians or compete with each other on a political level, a senior government official claimed.
State officials say that the military has informed military commanders in the area through attachés who have been in Zimbabwe that they have no intention of overthrowing Mugabe, but of dealing with the "criminals" around him.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to again tempt Mnangaga to return from a short exile in South Africa so that they could talk about subversion and succession.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The people of South Africa, a key element in the process - not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because of the fact that the then president Jacob Zuma was president of Sadc - refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the army invades Mugabe's house, as it has repeatedly threatened in the background, South African troops will immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and the African leaders didn't choose this route," said an informant to the Independent.
China needs strong leadership or it will "fall apart" as stated in the policy paper
China needs strong, unified Communist Party leadership because otherwise the country will "fall apart," the government said in a policy paper issued on Friday, the eve of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's press office reported in the White Paper that the country's successes since the communists took power 70 years ago come down to party leadership.
China occupies a large area, has complex national conditions, but rarely see the difficulties of administration.
The document mentions that without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move towards division and disintegration, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long been using a hard-handed policy to solve problems, as in the case of the suppression of the pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, on the grounds of the need to maintain stability in the country.
Strongly in power, President Xi Jinping, who on Tuesday will lead the celebration of the world's second-largest economy, has tightened the party's rule even further since he took office in late 2012 and issued sanctions against those who might challenge the government.
Xi also oversees the military modernization program, which has upset the region.
The document states that China does not seek to export its development model, nor does it want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, not "hegemony.
The Chinese do not have in their genes the conquest of other nations or domination over the world.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by the great powers, and wars and unrest have left a deep mark on it through the suffering it has suffered; China will never inflict on others the suffering it has suffered itself.
China is celebrating this anniversary in uncertain times for a country embroiled in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy and anti-government protests in China-administered Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to harm its sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade wars and further increases in customs tariffs do not lead to solutions to the problems.
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a wide market place and a strong economic growth rate.
The document adds that "trade wars will never weaken it".
China is confident that it is able to face up to the difficulties, turn the crisis into new opportunities and open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should look at China's development rationally, because China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor do they want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that it will halt its development.
Restricting and weakening other countries, and transferring domestic misunderstandings abroad, will not give the United States a strong position.
The world of Jacek Pałkiewicz: Dubai, the true face
The Dubai emirate is a place still searching for its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, religious Islamic radicalism and progressive extremism.
This trend-setting leader of global tourism awakens imagination and desires, clutching the vanity of wealthy snobby hotels and attracting fortune-seeking investors and traders with the status of a tax haven.
Websites infect the enthusiasm for this dream city, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentration of 21st century architecture in one.
The emirate, which was founded on the oil-rich sands, has become an Eden for those who love the market, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are delighted with the ubiquitous splendor here, appreciate the creative hyperactivity and hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
This is a city whose motto says it all: "to surprise, stun and enchant".
And that at almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
As the British writer Lawrence Osborne notes, "the metropolis, full of extremes and contradictions, has taken on a trashy grotesque dimension.
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the "Guinness Book of Records," the unofficial constitution of the emirate.
Because here everything must be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
However, among the thicket of excesses and ostentatious superfluous excesses, there is something that is perhaps not very transparent in old Europe, but important for the quality of life.
In Wroclaw, Berlin or Madrid everyone feels at home.
And in Dubai, it certainly is not.
Running away from the world of magic, I ripped off its golden mask, revealing the other face of artificial paradise.
A face that is not spoken or written about.
I show the poverty of the Asians in contrast to the fairy-tale living conditions of the divine Dubai ethnic caste, the illiterate Bedouin grandchildren.
I venture into places of extreme poverty, for example the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where there is an army of Asian workers in cruel conditions.
It was they who built the Manhattan Desert Heaven in one generation under slave conditions.
They came here, visited by the good earnings and the opportunity to provide a decent life for their families, and they found a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it, because it could blow up the myth of Dubai created over the years.
The increasing criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheap labour highly problematic for the Emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team forbade her home to talk about diets after her struggle with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm from Spice Girls admitted that there is a ban on diets in her home after she herself had struggled with nutritional disorders, eating only fruit and vegetables for years.
Spice Spice has not matured for years and has been "obsessed with exercise" due to the pressure of being a member of the world-famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
She now reveals that her experiences influence the way her daughter Scarlet is brought up, and therefore "does not allow the talk of diets in her home.
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I'm beginning to see that she's more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I think one of the positive things about experiencing eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak to her.
Using positive language has now become a habit of mine.
In an interview with Women's Health Mel magazine, who became famous in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that "outrageous" comments about her made in the press in the days before the social media were created.
"I started to look at myself in the wrong way, giving up certain groups of food products, exercising more and more obsessively until I started to be underweight. - he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted several years."
The picture that shook the world
A Polish girl and an American documentary filmmaker gave the world testimony about the cruelty of war.
The legendary photo of Julien Bryan can be seen in the Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk.
"Listen to my story.
I am speaking from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish nation about what has happened here.
America has to work, it has to help!", began his radio speech documentary filmmaker, photographer, Julien Bryan.
On the tragic September days of 1939 he was in the Polish capital, he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His account has been widely echoed in the West.
The President of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a farewell letter to his family in the USA, deposited it in the safe of the embassy and... He stayed.
For the next four weeks he tried to be wherever Warsawers were.
400 planes and artillery attacked the city almost non-stop.
Bryan immortalized death, suffering and the struggle for survival in the ruins of the city.
Just before the capitulation, he and the embassy staff took the negatives overseas.
He did not stop talking about the crimes of Hitler.
He appealed to the world: "What has happened to Warsaw will happen to Paris, London and even New York.
His shocking chronicles were seen by President Eleonora Roosevelt.
Soon the USA started to prepare for war.
"Dad showed the truth and thus fought against German propaganda.
They were making films glorifying their chivalry.
They said they did not attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
The trial before a jury against a former athlete accused of numerous rapes
A rape case against the former baseball player of the Delaware University team is pending before the jury, who is accused of numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of giving testimony and hearing arguments, the members of the jury proceeded to settle the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman over 21 claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two of them made friends on the Bumble meetings page and the man sent the woman a picture of him presenting himself naked.
The woman is one of six accusing Conaway of sexual assault in 2013-2018.
According to the accusers, the hugging, to which the woman consented, turned into rape, which met with her opposition.
The defenders cite the woman's contradictory relations and memory gaps and claim that she probably regretted the intimate rapprochement.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bicycle for one million PLN
A gold-plated bicycle worth one million zlotys could be seen at the jubilee 10th edition of the Kielce International Bike Fair BIKE-EXPO.
It is an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His constructor, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, has just received an Oscar for him at the World Custom Bicycle Exhibition in Las Vegas.
An unusual specimen made a furore at the fair. - The bike is covered with gold chrome spray, underneath it is the highest quality silver.
This is an unusual coating made by my friend from Zory.
"There is a saddle, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, you could drive it normally.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bicycle", says the constructor.
"The body of the bike was printed on a 3D printer.
These are cubes that form a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model riding my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on a piece of paper and put it deep into the drawer.
The sketch waited five years for realization.
The bicycle itself was built for three years", adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all elements under the body.
Inside there are batteries, cables, elements forming the structure.
It is hidden under the body, which is placed in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
The engine is also hidden there.
The steering wheel for this bicycle was made a week before my departure to the United States for the World Bicycle Exhibition.
I couldn't quite decide what this steering wheel should be.
It folds for transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he concludes.
The gold-plated bicycle has been appreciated in Las Vegas for the most important competition category "Best Amazing single custom copy".
The footage shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Zatoka Sydney otoczona przez budynek opery, port Circular Quay, park rozrywki Luna Park i oczywiście słynny most Harbour Bridge wnosi swój istotny wkład w kwotę 21,9 mld dolarów, corocznie wpompowywaną w australijską gospodarkę przez turystów odwiedzających Sydney.
Jednak pod mostem skrywa się brzydka prawda.
Znana zatoka Sydney jest jedną z najbardziej skażonych dróg wodnych w kraju, do której co roku wpływa objętość zanieczyszczeń równa pojemności około 15 basenów olimpijskich.
Te przerażające statystyki sprawiają, że jeden z naszych największych turystycznych atutów jest jednocześnie jednym z naszych najbrudniejszych akwenów.
Według nowego materiału filmowego zatytułowanego „Zatoka Sydney – na górze i na dole”, wody w okolicy najpopularniejszego miasta Australii są pełne niedopałków, plastikowych siatek i butelek, zgubionych butów i części odzieży, a nawet martwych zwierząt, a wszystko to spływa do zatoki wraz ze ściekami deszczowymi.
Jednak największa część składowa dusząca nasze kanały żeglugowe to plastik.
„Nazwałabym to paradoksem” – mówi w opublikowanym 27 września materiale wideo dr Katherine Dafforn, zastępca dyrektora programu badawczego Sydney Harbour Research Program, przy czym publikacja tego filmu celowo zbiega się w czasie ze Światowym Dniem Turystyki.
Akwen ten wygląda pięknie, ale jest jednym z najbardziej zmienionych i skażonych ujść rzek wzdłuż naszego wybrzeża.
Agencja CSIRO szacuje, że co godzinę około 1560 kg plastiku przedostaje się do naszych dróg wodnych, a jego większa część wpływa do zatoki poprzez kanalizację burzową.
„Po tak potężnych opadach zatoka... wygląda to dość tragicznie” – powiedziała dr Dafforn.
Dwie trzecie zanieczyszczeń pochodzi ze ścieków deszczowych.
Jednak podobnie jak w przypadku góry lodowej problem z zatoką Sydney jest znacznie poważniejszy pod powierzchnią wody, gdyż 70% plastiku przedostającego się do oceanu trafia na dno morza.
„Według mnie, o ile nie spędzi się czasu pod wodą, nie można naprawdę uświadomić sobie tego, co znajduje się tam w głębi” – powiedział Richard Nicholls, właściciel Dive Centre Manly, zwracając uwagę, że on i jego zespół samodzielnie wyciągają z wody około 500 kg plastiku rocznie.
Myślę, że gdyby więcej osób wiedziało (co znajduje się pod wodą), byliby po prostu przerażeni.
To przytłaczające... ponad połowa tego, co znajdujemy na dnie to plastikowe siatki.
Pozostałe 50% to rzeczy, które są co najmniej wykonane z tworzywa sztucznego.
Kiedy patrzysz na zatokę, wygląda pięknie, a ludzie nie mogą uwierzyć, że cały ten plastik i te pozostałe śmieci wydobywamy tuż spod powierzchni.
Jeremy Brown, współzałożyciel i dyrektor zarządzający Ocean Protect, stwierdził, że istnieją sposoby, w jaki ludzie – zarówno miejscowi, jak i turyści – mogliby pomóc zmniejszyć ilość plastiku i resztek przedostających się do naszych dróg wodnych.
„To musi się zacząć u źródła” – powiedział.
Musimy zmniejszyć ilość używanego przez nas plastiku, lepiej prowadzić odzysk materiałów i mieć większą świadomość tego, co spuszczamy w ściekach, które ostatecznie trafiają do oceanów.
Jeżeli zniszczymy ocean, czeka nas zagłada, ponieważ 50% wdychanego przez nas tlenu pochodzi z oceanu.
Wchłania on 30% dwutlenku węgla i nasze źródło pożywienia.
Jednak możemy uporządkować tę zatokę i przywrócić ją do dawnej świetności, a to bardzo proste.
Jeśli uśmiercimy nasze oceany, zabijemy też samych siebie.
Materiał filmowy, sfinansowany przez przedsiębiorstwo recyklingowe TOMRA w ramach jego szerszych starań mających na celu edukację Australijczyków w zakresie ochrony środowiska i zmniejszenia negatywnego wpływu pojemników na napoje, które często trafiają do środowiska, zbiega się w czasie z badaniem na temat zależności pomiędzy tworzywami sztucznymi a zdrowiem psychicznym, którego wyniki opublikowano w tym miesiącu.
