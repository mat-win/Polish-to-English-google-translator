A new survey of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 found that 82% of respondents felt helpless about plastic waste, and 25% blamed adults for the problem of disposable plastic packaging waste.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth largest concern for parents, with 93% of 551 parents surveyed saying their concern was growing about the amount of plastic waste leaking into the oceans.
Many people who participated in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but simply didn't know how to make meaningful changes, which led to environmental anxiety.

Memes after the volleyball players' match in the European Championships
It wasn't an easy game.
The Slovenes had a lively audience on their side, which effectively distracted Polish volleyball players.
The judges, who did not count four bounces on the side of the hosts, also aroused a lot of controversy.
It happened at a crucial moment in the first set, when Vital Heynen's players had a chance to jump back and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles finally had to recognize the superiority of the rival, who will play in the final of the tournament after winning 3: 1.

Google creates the cloud in Poland.
A partner of PKO BP
The operator of Chmury Krajowej, a company of PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
The cooperation is to help Polish companies to implement and use the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open the so-called Google Cloud region - a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global public cloud computing installation in Central Europe.
The digitization of Polish enterprises was one of the key assumptions underlying the project to create the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, the company's shareholders.
The partnership between Chmury Krajowej and Google is another important step on the road that we chose less than a year ago when we announced the establishment of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged - digitization of the Polish economy and acceleration of its growth.
“Now Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances of promotion to the world league, which is something we all care about.
The fact that Google is joining them today significantly strengthens our joint project, ”says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of PKO Bank Polski.
The Polish Development Fund emphasizes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and enterprises.
“The investment in Operator Chmury Krajowej fits perfectly into the PFR strategy as an important element of the country's digitization.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists to it," adds Paweł Borys, president of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on a leading technical infrastructure that provides computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find in the service portfolio all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that are used by their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators ”, emphasizes Michał Potoczek, president of Operator Chmury Krajowej.
He adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which many times increase the demand for computing power necessary to process huge data sets.
VI National Parade of Seniors
At noon, on August 24, 2019, at Rondo de Gaulle'a in Warsaw, the VI Parade of Seniors "Mature Magnificent" and the Picnic of Generations began, events organized by the Zaczyn Foundation.
As Przemysław Wiśniewski from the Foundation said: “The parade is a phenomenon on a global scale.
For the sixth time it has gone through the center of Warsaw to demonstrate how large and diverse the community the seniors are.
Through the Parade, we counteract harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for intergenerational solidarity ”.
The parade was led by a special double-decker bus serving as a mobile music stage, where the famous Warsaw DJ Wika performed as usual.
Participants in a joyful parade, accompanied by famous Warsaw and world hits, walked along Aleje Jerozolimskie, ul. Krucza to Powstańców Warszawy Square, ul. Mazowiecka to J. Piłsudski Square and ul. Królewska and Krakowskie Przedmieście to the Main Campus of the University of Warsaw.
During the march, which was attended by over a dozen thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organizations from all over Poland, colorful delegations were greeted with applause by numerous Varsovians and tourists gathered on the route.
From Legionowo, two organized groups wearing yellow and blue corporate T-shirts took part in the parade.
The first one representing the University of the Third Age and the Senior + Club, and the second under the name SAGA, i.e. Seniorska Active Group of Animators.
At the University Campus, the organizers prepared, among others gastronomic stalls and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering services and products to seniors to improve their everyday life and functioning.
There are medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the stand of Stylish Seniors of the Senior Voice from professionals Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrwal, you could get tips and information on current trends in 60+ fashion.
The stand also offered a workshop for learning how to move around the stage and pose for photos.
The culmination was the fashion show of Stylish Seniors.
At the stand of the Polish Senior Voice, there was the latest edition of the magazine and materials related to the "Stop manipulation - Don't buy at the presentation!" Campaign.
Other stands offered cosmetic, movement, art and art workshops.
Several of them were available for research and consultation with health and nutrition specialists.
Discussion panels were also organized with the participation of, among others: Helena Norowicz, Beata Tadla, Mariola Bojarska-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykow and Robert Janowski.
There were vocal and musical attractions at the picnic.
The legend of Polish song Krzysztof Krawczyk performed on the stage, and in the evening there was an intergenerational dance led by DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide tips on treating cancer
Tasmanian devils may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have made groundbreaking discovery that could revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way to mask certain cancer cells
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and in humans
The hope is that this discovery will lead to new treatments for cancer patients
What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that may become invisible.
Researchers, including from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough that could help revolutionize the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also hold the key to treating deadly facial tumors that threaten the future of an endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study found a way to mask certain cancer cells in both humans and marsupials with a group of proteins called PRC2, which turns off a marker that would otherwise signal the immune system to attack the cancer.
This may present the greatest challenge in treating small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and a type of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.
"The huge significance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immune therapies, we may be able to reverse the process," said AAP lead researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to reintroduce markers, proteins called MHCs, which will allow the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
"This has potentially far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
Perhaps we can treat her much better.
The researchers also hope that the discovery will someday be used to treat Tasmanian devil facial tumors, where cancer cells similarly escape detection.
"What's remarkable is that exactly the same process occurs (in human cancer and in Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
“Until now, it has been very difficult to treat Tasmanian devil tumors.
But if drugs that work for humans can also be used on Tasmanian devils, the possibility is that it will help control the disease. '
Scientists are amazed at the fact that a very small star is orbiting a very large planet
Scientists are surprised to discover a solar system 30 light-years from Earth, which challenges our current understanding of planet formation, as a large Jupiter-like planet orbits a small star called a red dwarf.
Artistic illustration of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting a central red dwarf star, published September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest orbiting planets.
However, the scientists said on Thursday that in this case the star and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of the star GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the orbiting planet is at least half that of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"Yes, this is an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Space Research Institute at the Spanish Space Research Institute, which led the study published in Science.
The finding is surprising because theoretical models of solar system formation suggest that low-mass stars tend to become host stars for smaller Earth-like planets or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a gas giant planet like Jupiter orbiting a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, which, like Jupiter, is mostly gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star in a very elliptical orbit and takes 204 days to complete a complete orbit.
Red dwarfs are small and have a relatively low surface temperature.
Not only is the star GJ 3512 much smaller than the Sun, it is to some extent about the size of a very large planet, being only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low, approximately below 3800 Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have a reddish color," said Morales.
"There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while a third planet may have been ejected from the star system in the past, which could explain the planet's elliptical orbit similar to Jupiter," said Morales.
Planets are formed from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to the star around which the planets orbit.
According to the leading model of planetary formation called the accretion model, an object is initially formed from solid particles in a disk, and the gravitational force of a planet at an early stage of development allows an atmosphere to form from surrounding gas.
This unusual system could explain a competing model called the gravitational instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and may be cold," said Morales.
This disrupts the stability of the disk and therefore some denser areas may appear.
These masses can build up until they collapse and form a planet.
Delicatessen worker accused of giving a coworker a bean dip containing methamphetamine
The Marion County Sheriff's Office detained Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, for giving an associate a bean dip containing methamphetamine.
Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez, 38, originally from Albany, was charged on Thursday with delivering methamphetamine and causing someone else to consume it - both crimes are second-degree crimes.
The prosecution was based on the incident of September 9 at a Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In a sworn statement on the probability of guilt from OregonLive.com, the suspect's 27-year-old associate told Marion County Sheriff's Deputies that she had seen Medina-Hernandez making a bean dip, which she then offered to her during her lunch break.
It is known from the statement that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she told investigators, had never taken methamphetamine, said she "thought one piece she had eaten tasted strange, but it did not raise any suspicions."
When she returned to work, she felt her stomach upset and that she could not stand upright.
According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to a local hospital where it was found that the bean dip might contain methamphetamine.
Another Thriftway employee said Medina-Hernandez "told her she would add drugs to her food", according to The Smoking Gun, while another admitted that the suspect had sent her a message saying methamphetamine had ended up in the bean dip via case.
OregonLive's website reports on a deli surveillance recording that allegedly shows Medina-Hernandez with her back to the camera pulling something from her bra, standing behind the microwave, and bending over.
Then he straightens up, blows his nose, goes to the table and puts the bean dip in a small paper dish.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of the bra was also probably on the plate.
The Oregon-based Statesman-Journal reports that sheriff's office officials say there is currently no suspicion that customers were served contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Jail for $ 520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman has already been convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, supplying methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of illicit weapons.
Johnson deals the blow in the confusion of postponement
Boris Johnson's trip to the United Nations General Assembly was inelegantly interrupted by a historic Supreme Court ruling.
However, his devastating speech in the House of Commons betrayed neither shame nor remorse.
To make sense of this upheaval, Tony Connelly, editor of the European section of RTE in Brussels and London correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster, are in the eye of the storm.

Marcin Komenda after the match with Slovenia (1: 3).
“The Slovenes played very well in every element.
It's a pity for the ending of the sets, because we had our chances, but we didn't use them.
We do not hang our heads, because on Saturday we will play for the bronze medal, ”said the quarterback of the Polish volleyball team, Marcin Komenda, after defeating Slovenia 1: 3 in the semi-final of the European championship.
The talented player appeared on the field in the second and third sets.
According to some, Vital Heynen should give him a better chance to show off his skills.
The Eagles selector, however, focused on the experience of Fabian Drzyzga.

What is KAS doing in the case of the head of the Supreme Audit Office?
Renting a property for an amount below the market price - these are reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Marian Banas.
We asked the Tax Administration Chamber in Kraków and the Ministry of Finance about what the tax office is doing in this matter.
Bertold Kittel in his reportage for TVN's "Supervisor" presented doubts about the property declarations of the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Marian Banas.
The Central Anticorruption Bureau has been examining them for several months.
The scrutiny is expected to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to statements, Banaś was to rent a tenement house with an area of ​​400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received PLN 65.7 thousand per year.
The report of the "Supervisor" revealed that the tenement house he rented housed a hotel for hours.
The head of the Supreme Audit Office later explained on state television why he only charged a little over PLN 5,000 a month for renting a property.
Gazeta Wyborcza, citing experts in real estate valuation, estimated that for the tenement house itself it should be PLN 15,000 per month.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary contract and it was the fact that the tenant was to buy the tenement house that made me agree to a lower rent, that the remaining amounts would be settled when the tenement was sold," argued Banaś.
However, there were doubts as to whether such proceedings did not constitute an infringement of the law.
Konrad Zawada, the press spokesman of the Chamber of Tax Administration in Krakow, in an interview with TVN24 informed that "this matter is dealt with directly by the Ministry of Finance".
"Please address any such questions to the Finance Minister," he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases "the activities are carried out by the National Tax Administration".
A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, Paweł Jurek, admitted that the National Revenue Administration itself monitors many matters that may raise some concerns.
“The National Revenue Administration works in such a way that it has its own information, and is based, in a sense, on information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it decides whether to conduct any proceedings in a specific case or not, ”the spokesman for the Ministry of Finance explained.
"However, due to the fact that we are all bound by the entire Ministry of Finance, fiscal secrecy, so we never express our opinion, because we cannot express our opinion on individual matters of a specific taxpayer, person or company," he emphasized when asked about Marian's case Banasia.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński emphasized that "tax offices do not pass this type of news to the public".
"It is known that the entire fiscal apparatus deals with very many similar cases across the country," he pointed out.
Royal Secrets: Surprising visitors often flying on the royal plane have been revealed
As part of their job responsibilities, royalty must travel hundreds of times around the world throughout their lives.
This is usually facilitated by the royal plane - a private machine that carries the royal family around the world to important events and speeches.
Not surprisingly, having your own plane comes with privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long lines at check-in, there are no limits on the number of luggage, and, as it turns out, they can invite any guests - including truly unusual ones.
According to the recently premiered Channel 5 documentary, not only the Queen and Prince Philip frequently travel on the royal plane.
During a show titled "Secrets of the Royal Flight", the former Queen's flight navigator revealed that furry guests often flew with the royal family.
Bob Shields said, "At times, very important royal dogs may fly with our very important royal guests."
It is not surprising that the Queen may have asked for her beloved pets to accompany her on her travels, as she is known for her deep devotion to corgi dogs.
From an early age, Queen Elizabeth was a lover of these four-legged creatures and it is rumored that since her coronation she has owned over 30 corgi.
In 2007, she is said to have had five corgi: Monty, Emma, ​​Linnet, Willow, and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dachshund and corgi cross dogs: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The crew of the royal plane must have been busy.
A royal house worker has been seen walking the dogs and asking them to take care of their needs before taking them aboard the plane, Shields continues.
I am pleased to say that no incident has ever happened.
The program also revealed the shocking amount of luggage that the Queen takes on board when traveling as part of her official duties.
The narrator of the film stated: "In 1953, the Queen took luggage weighing 12 tons on her journey of 70,000 kilometers."
To illustrate this better, it is about the same as two huge elephants.
However, the queen is not the only one with a soft spot for fashion.
It is said that the Duchess of Cambridge also has her own preferences for transporting her wardrobe - it is said that each of her dresses has a separate seat.
The new law comes into force.
Accident victims will receive pensions
On Friday, a regulation enters into force ensuring that seriously injured persons continue to pay pensions, informs the Financial Ombudsman.
It is about the Act of July 9, 2019 on the special rights of injured persons in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee sum determined on the basis of the provisions in force before January 1, 2006.
It concerns people who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were much lower than at present, so in some cases the insurers have already ceased to pay pensions.
"I am happy with this regulation, because our institution has been trying for many years to create a mechanism that will allow seriously injured victims of accidents with a guarantee of financial support from motor third party liability insurance, despite exhausting the guarantee sum," says Aleksander Daszewski, attorney-at-law in the Ombudsman's office Financial.
In the opinion of the Financial Ombudsman, it was necessary, because these are often very tragic situations, concerning people in very poor health, who due to an accident cannot work, for example, and at the same time incur significant costs of rehabilitation after an accident.
Some of them no longer received compensatory benefits and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sums on third party liability insurance policies.
Some of this threatened in the coming years.
Until January 1, 2006, the insurer's liability limits were significantly lower than the present.
Therefore, the problem of exhausting the guarantee sum in the previous years most often affected people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee sums were very low, and economic conditions resulted in a significant increase in prices.
“We also noticed that this problem also affected a number of mostly young people who suffered a loss in the period when the sum amounted to PLN 350,000. euro for each person injured in an accident.
Currently, it is EUR 5.21 million per incident, regardless of the number of victims.
So it is a huge difference from the previous periods, hence the problem required the legislator's intervention, ”reminds Aleksander Daszewski.
He explains that due to the fact that the guarantee sum is increased from time to time, the legislator assumed that the upper limit of liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee sum applicable at the time of referring the claim to the Fund for the payment of an annuity.
This rule applies if the insurance company is not obliged to pay the annuity on the basis of a court decision establishing a different amount of the guarantee sum than that specified in the civil liability insurance contract.
This is the case when the guarantee sum is increased in court pursuant to Art. 3571 of the Civil Code, which enables modification of the existing obligation relationship.
“In recent days, we have sent letters to people who have asked us to intervene in the past.
We inform you about the new rights and, of course, that we can provide further support in case of any problems, ”says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off her boyfriend's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, it was then that Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed friends a sex tape that was made in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect by profession, explained to the court that her partner ruined her life in this way and treated her like a "trophy" that you can show off to your friends.
“It has violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything, ”she argued.
The inhabitant of Cordoba decided to bring justice herself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F., to bed and told him that she had prepared a special surprise.
She covered his eyes with a velvet band, then grabbed the shears and cut off his penis.
“I felt like I was going to die.
I have not seen anything.
I tried to get up, pulled up my pants and grabbed my mobile phone to call an ambulance, testified the victim.
“I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my T-shirt and hair, not letting me go, ”he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by revealing the sex tape, she did not try to escape the responsibility.
"I am asking for justice," she said to the jury.
Ultimately, she was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama Congressman Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, retired Alabama Congressman from the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called The Deep South.
A family spokesman said Edwards had died at his home in Fairhope after battling pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the US Congress in 1965 as one of the first Alabama Republicans in the Deep South because the party gained supporters here.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what world he would like to leave to his great-grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Edwards replied that he would like the courtesy back.
"I hope my great-grandsons and my great-granddaughters will grow up in a country where courtesy will return to common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems," Edwards said, according to a family statement.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said Edwards served his state and country with the highest standards of integrity.
She added that in his honor, the flags on the Alabama State Capitol would be lowered half-mast.
“He was the epitome of a true government official and was Alabama's best statesman.
Our state has lost one of its most eminent politicians, Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama gave her high praise to Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the mold and makes our world a better place."
The Duchess and Prince Harry, currently on a 10-day royal trip to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth meeting earlier this week where they met with Obama Foundation leaders.
"I would like to thank my friend Her Majesty the Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal," the caring leader who breaks the mold and makes our world a better place, "wrote the former First Lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Whether meeting the leaders of the Obama @ ObamaFoundation Foundation or helping girls around the world get the education they deserve is an inspiration to many people," Obama added, posting a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with the foundation leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, the ex-actress-edited series "Suits".
In a candid conversation, the former first lady spoke about motherhood and how it changed her.
"Being a mother means mastering the art of letting go," Obama said in an interview.
“Motherhood has taught me that most of the time my job is to give children space to explore the world and become what they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are at heart.
Obama, who knows from experience the pressure of being in the spotlight, shared the advice with the Duchess during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel - whether imposed by yourself and by others - can overwhelm you at times," she said.
“So my advice is to slow down and take your time.
I spent the first few months at the White House worrying about my daughters, making sure they were doing well at school and making new friends before devoting myself to more ambitious work.
I think this is also needed.
Hotel Trumpa retains permission to sell alcohol despite complaints about the disposition of the owner
WASHINGTON (AP) - Washington's Alcohol Inspection Commission dismissed a request seeking a review of whether a local Trump International Hotel should lose its liquor license because of the owner's disposition.
The agency ruled on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis was unfounded, as most of them do not live in or own property in the district.
The Washington Post reports that this is a second time that these plaintiffs are seeking to revoke a hotel license to sell alcohol, citing district law that alcohol license applicants must be "of good disposition."
The original complaint, filed last summer, alleged that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and cited assault and repeated fraud allegations.
The complaint was dismissed as the license was granted before it was submitted.
The second action was based on the renewal of the authorization.
The Sun: Crushing Report Claims Scandalous Cleveland Police Service is UK's Worst
Inspectors named the police COMPROMISED SCANDALS the worst in the UK.
In a devastating report, they rated the work of the Cleveland Police Department inadequate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspectorate says there has been a "significant deterioration" in the Cleveland Police Service.
There were new appeals calling for the dissolution of the police service, headed by five chiefs over the past six years.

Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspectorate said, "There has been a significant deterioration in standards since our last inspection."
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year following an investigation into "serious", albeit undisclosed, allegations about his conduct.
Deputy Commandant Adrian Roberts was suspended from detention on charges of gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared before a misdemeanor committee for sexually training female associates.
He left the service.
Tory Mayor Ben Houchen said: “This is official confirmation that this service is compromised.
Now is the time for the Home Office department to intervene now. "
Police Chief Richard Lewis said: "With the improvements, I take full responsibility for guiding the police force through the changes."

Older residents are disturbed by young enthusiasts of scooters and skateboards, while those complain that there is no suitable place for them in Oława.
For years, young people have been asking for a place to ride on roller skates, skateboards, scooters and bicycles.
The topic keeps coming back to our columns.
We have been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Recently it got loud again about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we come back to it again and ask the office what's next?
We would like to remind you that a few days ago a woman, who is disturbed by young people driving in the center, spoke.
"I am writing on behalf of the residents of the block at pl. Piłsudski, so that one could become interested in the situation of the youth in Oława, 'writes Małgorzata to the editorial office.
“The inhabitants of the block of flats called the City Guard many times to no avail.
As proof of such everyday situations, I enclose photos ”.
We asked others for their opinion on this matter.
Most clearly state that young people simply have nowhere to go in the city and have been unsuccessfully demanding a place for themselves for years.
There was an avalanche of comments under the post on Facebook.
Already in July we wrote that there is a chance that the skatepark will be built in the town of Oława.
The mayor informed that the city applied for funding for the construction of a skatepark.
“The project with the permits consulted with the youth is ready.
On March 28, an application was sent to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding of the task entitled «Building a Skatepark in Oława» as part of the Sportowa Polska program, we were told in the office.
Total value of the project: PLN 798 306.00.
The requested grant amount: PLN 263,440.00.
Now we asked again at what stage the case is.
"We do not yet have information about the decisions regarding the application for funding submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism," informs Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the Department of European Funds at Oława City Hall.
"The information obtained from the employees of the ministry shows that the final selection of all tasks under the Sports Poland Program should take place in October".
We also asked for a visualization of the Oława skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editors that next Saturday (September 28) they would be collecting signatures for a petition regarding the construction of a skatepark in Oława.
"The rebellious youth saw the latest post on Facebook and concluded that they would organize a fundraiser," Mikołaj writes to the editorial office.
Signatures under the petition will be collected from 12.00 in the vicinity of the Lidl market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: the draw for the 1/16 finals.
We know couples, a hit from years ago
It was one of the fiercest rivalries in the league.
The memorable match of the 1996/1997 season became the biggest legend.
On June 18, 1997, Legia played the Lodz team in the penultimate line at the old stadium on Łazienkowska Street.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, Widzew was given a point for the second consecutive Polish championship.
Until the 87th minute, Legia was leading 2-0, but for the next five minutes there was an earthquake - Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.
Over the years, the club from Lodz got into more and more trouble, until it ceased to count in the fight for the championship and fell from the top league.
The last time both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia - on the way to the title - achieved two victories - 5: 1 at home and 1: 0 away.
Return to the elite
Currently, the inhabitants of Łódź are fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed by at least a year, because in previous competitions, being one of the favorites, they failed to advance to the back of the league.
Due to this failure, a personnel revolution took place in the club in the summer.
The authorities have changed, the coach of Marcin Kaczmarek was finally chosen, and Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdżeń, seasoned in league battles, are to help in taking the next step up the club hierarchy.
For now, Widzew is fourth in the II league table, but in the Polish Cup they defeated the second-league leader Śląsk Wrocław 2-0 on Tuesday.
Legia in the same sizes beat the Niepołomice Forest away.
First league clash
The only pair consisting of representatives of the highest class in the 1/16 finals are its newbies ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The matches of this phase will take place on October 29–31.
This year, the 1/8 finals (December 3-5) are also scheduled to be played.
The final is to take place on May 2 at the PGE Narodowy in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr 'rebelled' and the impeachment investigation must go on its way
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are participating in a concealment of the facts of a concealment attempt, and an investigation into this may take a long time, ”Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on Capitol Hill.
"They will do the work they started, sticking to the facts and the time it takes to find them," she added.
According to a protocol released this week by the White House, Trump has asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, the 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenskiy to collaborate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Red Giuliani, on the case, according to the minutes.
Trump has denied that he has done anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Justice Department had notified a whistleblower's complaint about Trump's conduct involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.
After receiving the complaint as a report from officials in the Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice said Trump's phone call did not provide a criminal investigation into campaign funding.
When asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said the Intelligence Committee would decide on Friday who to call as a witness.
But she added that she thought Barr had "rebelled".
This condition has been going on for a long time.
"But (Barra) is mentioned in all this," added Pelosi, referring to Trump's reference to his attorney general during a July conversation with Ukraine's leader.
It is interesting that he made decisions about how to handle the complaint.
Pelosi said she was "very afraid" about whistle-blower informants Trump attacked as spies on Thursday, suggesting that spies had been handled differently in the past.
I believe that the President's words go beyond irresponsibility, it is dangerous.
Our whistleblowers play an important role in uncovering - uncovering wrongdoings in our government, "Pelosi said, adding" The President's words about those who could inform the whistleblower seriously undermine government integrity.
On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of announcing a formal investigation into the commission of an unlawful act based on allegations of trying to pressure a foreign country leader for political gain.
The phone call was included in a complaint released Thursday in which the whistleblower alleged that Trump abused his power to "trick Ukraine into interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers ordered officials to remove the record of the conversation from the computer system where it is stored for the needs of the officials of the Council of Ministers and place it in a system designed for particularly sensitive information.

Possible speeding ban for Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke
Premier League star Christian Benteke, who has been caught speeding twice in the past two months, faces a driving ban.
The Crystal Palace striker, 28, pleaded guilty to driving a Bentley car at 80mph on the ground restricted to 50mph on the A3 highway in Richmond, South West London on January 20.
Then, in March, speed cameras in Putney in south-west London recorded a Belgian traveling at 89mph, double the 40mph limit.
Benteke from Kingston Hill, Surrey, doesn't have to appear at Lavender Hill Peace Court this morning.
He pleaded guilty to both offenses in early July under a simplified procedure whereby minor offenses are tried in a hearing chaired by one magistrate.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and representative of Sekondi Hasaacas, raised concerns about the composition of the Verification Committee for the upcoming elections to the Ghana National Football Association (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of Commission President Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be honest, as the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Commission should be composed of neutral external persons who do not show any ties to any of the members and who have previously shown no interest.
For example, Davies hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer regarding the 10 percent payment.
He is also a famous supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to serve on the Verification Committee as he has an interest in that, ”he claimed.
Manu stated that should Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, face the Committee, there would be a conflict of interest for the President due to his affiliation with the club, suggesting that if Palmer was brought before the Committee, he would be subject to bias and bias.
As expected, members of the Commission were to start work yesterday after being sworn in at a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday 19 September, and finish on October 4.
Frank Davies is the President of the Commission, and its members are Corporate Governance Consultant and Lawyer, Ms Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business, and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the unity government
Israel's two main parties, the Blue-White and Likud alliance, continued negotiations on Friday to establish a government of unity.
The meeting that took place after the president entrusted Benjamin Netanyahu with the mission to form the government did not produce any results.
The talks considered the possibility of a rotating presidency of both parties in the government and Netanyahu's remaining as prime minister, but - as the Israeli daily Haarec writes - there was no convergence of views.
The talks will resume on Sunday.
The centrist alliance of the Blue-Whites announced in a press release that it presented preliminary demands.
He accuses the right-wing Likud of "entrenching himself in his positions", demanding that its leader and outgoing prime minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government and the ultra-Orthodox politicians who were part of the cabinet.
"It was known from the outset that the Blue and Whites would not agree to these terms," ​​says their release.
Likud, acting solely in the interests of Netanyahu, wants to "bring Israel to the second round of elections."
Blue-and-white leader Benny Gantz refuses to endorse Netanyahu's government as long as he is facing charges of involvement in three corruption scandals that could have allowed the prosecution to formally indict him after Wednesday's meeting.
"Likud and Blue-White won a sufficient majority in the September 17 elections to allow them to rule together as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate the way neither side wanted," writes EFE.
President Reuwen Riwlin has sought to converge on their positions in recent days and has proposed the formation of a "rotating government", suggesting that the prime minister should temporarily suspend his office, which would allow Gantz to take up this position if the accusations against Netanyahu were upheld and formalized.
There is no shortage of Israeli analysts who believe that things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of Israelis, according to a poll released by public television on Friday, want to unlock the political situation in the country by appointing a government of unity under the rotating leadership of Netanyahu and Gantz alternately.
50.6 percent are in favor of such a solution. Israelis, 32.1 percent of respondents are against such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society - when asked who should be the first head of the cabinet, 41.8 percent. of respondents are in favor of Netanyahu, and 40 percent. after Gantz.
In another poll published by the daily Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government rises to 63 percent, 60 percent. is against a new election that would be the third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on September 17, the Gantz alliance won 33 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu and his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 MPs, while Gantz can count on 54.
None of the parties has collected the 61 seats necessary to achieve a majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight before a showdown with the Australians
Justin Tipuric says it is "time to test it" as Wales faces a World Cup final match against Australia that could shape their fortunes in the tournament.
A victory for Wales over the "kangaroos" would put them in the position of a favorite for the Group D win and guarantee their participation in the likely quarter-final game against France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales for the 14th time in the last 15 games, Tipuric and his team will be swiftly sent back to England in the eighth final.
"Let's be clear, both teams want to try to get through this and be in the lead of the group," said Welsh catcher Tipuric.
There have been some tough results in the past, but it was nice to win against them (Australia) last fall.
I think they will impatiently try to take this victory from us, and we absolutely want to win it again.
Before we came here, you knew it was going to be a big showdown.
And now we're here and it's really time to prove ourselves.
Wales has had only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history - 32 years ago in a match for third place, when they defeated the kangaroos.
And their overall record under head coach Warren Gatland shows just seven wins in 41 attempts to beat three southern hemisphere heavyweights.
Wales put a stop to a string of thirteen test losses at the hands of Australia last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few survivors of that 9-6 win who will run to the Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric, when asked if the team had experienced a mental block before this victory, added: "It's hard to say.
These matches are so close that maybe ... people expect there to be some mental block, I don't know.
In the end, we probably left around 15 points on the pitch in the last game, so the final result looks a lot less than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then Tipuric's battle against the beloved Australian third mill line duo Michael Hooper and David Pocock during a stop and knockdown will be essential.
Tipuric has played 67 for the national team and has faced both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
"They are absolutely world-class seventh players," he said.
When you play against the world-class players of the mill's third line, you always know there will be a tough game to play.
These two constantly compete with the best fighters in the world.
You know what kind of gameplay to expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world to play defensively and Michael is the more attacking seven and he is probably more comfortable with rugby because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best players in the world and challenge yourself than face the third mill line, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and when you struggle with these two, you definitely need to be in top form.
I wouldn't say that on Sunday there will be almost the cup final, but for us it is an important match in this World Cup.
The momentum is its important element.
When we build strength and constantly put in great effort, we will fly like wings and it will be hard to beat us.

"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were to be the elite organization of the "master race."
They took into their ranks those whom they despised.
Can crime connect more strongly than national identity?
We are presenting you with not another book on war or military.
We are offering an in-depth international study of the participation of non-Germans in the Waffen-SS.
Historians from various European countries analyze the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind about their activities and look at the recruitment processes at various stages of the war.
Were Danish troops different from French?
Where did the Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why was it not possible to create a unit composed of only Poles?
What is the official historical narrative of collaboration in different European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the end of the war?
Among other things, these questions are answered by the book "Waffen-SS" based on solid research material.
We aimed at presenting a subtler and more balanced, closer to the truth picture of collaboration in Europe during the Second World War, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period of history by presenting dissertations by researchers from various countries. (...) While the fates of the main victims of this war - forced laborers, Jews, prisoners of war, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavic population - are sometimes presented in a comparative and / or supranational perspective, the perpetrators are essentially examined from the national perspective (o how much is done).
"Total panic" as the White House struggles to find arguments on impeachment
White House officials struggle to figure out how to counter the impeachment pressures resumed on Thursday, and one familiar interviewee describes the feeling of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
It seems to add to "anxiety, uncertainty and fears" - one of the White House people describes the mood in the West Wing in this way - that the whistleblower's allegations could seriously harm the president and those around him.
The person stated, "There is no certainty that nothing is hiding there."
White House officials were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan to deal with such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the president's standard methods of successfully avoiding controversy in the past may not work. "It doesn't look like something that will go away with the next cycle of news headlines," the person quipped.
Another person familiar with the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as a "state of shock", accompanied by increasing distrust that with prolonged impeachment investigations, the likelihood that the president will respond irresponsibly and become "difficult to control" increases.
This concern is shared by another interlocutor saying that those around the president predict that he will display more "impulsive" behavior, and the pressure on him is sure to increase with each day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concerns that Trump may exhibit increasingly unpredictable behavior and explode unexpectedly - a concern in the context of an election year both for the presidency and the elections.
Faced with the greatest threat to date in the presidency, Trump has circled from attack to defense, again tapping into a strategy he judged to be effective in Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to downplay his own request to the Ukrainian president for help in investigating his political rivals to distract and divert attention to the actions of Democrats and Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and to discredit the informant as party driven.
But while many in the White House are seasoned after the Mueller investigation, this time something has changed, advisers and consultants said.
The president, whose hallmark is strength, announced Wednesday as a defeated president, said one familiar with the situation.
While Trump was enthusiastic about questions about the Russian investigation, he did not appear to be eager to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.
Some of the president's allies believe the damage can be avoided, and some stick to the fact that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of the aforementioned controversial phone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - which they believe undermines his credibility.
And as is often the case when a president is under attack, this fact is vividly raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one Republican strategist associated with the White House points out that the results of the president's support polls are exorbitantly high, and the impeachment will not significantly influence the acquisition of new supporters.
"There is no positive in the need to focus on the president's impeachment in the next four months," especially if that hinders his legislative agenda and prevails in the new cycle of news headlines.
Another interviewee said those who argued that impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his response would be.
Worried White House officials sought help from counselors, putting together an impeachment response team.
According to a knowledgeable person, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it remains unclear whether any command center-style initiative will be taken and what form it may take.
The person stated that there is a perception that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a determined leader capable of launching a PR attack as a response to the publication of a virulent whistleblower report and intended to contain the impeachment momentum brought by the disclosure of this report.
An interviewee familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was made clear when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they had no intention of releasing a memo describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was felt that they were not. has a way out and the document needs to be published.
It is predicted that the pressure will now be greater than during the investigation of Robert Mueller, who remained largely silent and spoke only through the accusations. One person who may be involved in developing the impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, Trump's dirty man and former chief of election staff, said the person involved.
However, Lewandowski said in an interview with NBC News that it was not true to suggest that he would be leading the action.
"Over the past five years, I have done everything I could to support the president and his program," he said, "but I have not been involved in any discussions with the president or his team about joining the team to counter the false impeachment narrative."
Donald Trump's private attorney from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in the impeachment efforts.
"We are responding properly," Sekulov responded when asked by NBC News for comment.
Currently, the White House lacks an experienced impeachment lawyer after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, has passed away, and current counsel, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
The interviewee, familiar with the White House strategy, stated that officials generally at no point planned to engage people or create a command center, but acknowledged the need for a coordinated, joint response and a person capable of leading the political struggle.

Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding 'naked pictures of Trump'
California Congressman Devin Nunes apparently cannot stand the naked truth that President Donald Trump is under investigation.
In his defense of the president on Thursday, he accused the Democrats of wanting nude photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, made the above allegation in an introductory hearing statement following a whistleblower's complaint that Trump had asked Ukraine to help initiate an investigation against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque depiction" of the left and its "media ace" before claiming that Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in negligee.
"The Democrats on this commission negotiated with what they believed were Ukrainian to get nude photos of Trump," said Nunes.
“People may rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to impeach the president when they have their chance in a year's time.
After Nunes finished his reprimand, HuffPost political reporter Jennifer Bendery set out to see if the Democrats were really trying to ... find out.
So far, only Connecticut representative Jim Himes has responded, although we suspect that his answer is the naked truth, which confirms the thoughts of many of his colleagues.
Mediaite.com suspects that Nunes' comments about the nudity referred to "some more lascivious and unsubstantiated information" likely to appear in Steele's controversial acts.
This is the infamous collection of allegations against Trump, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, indicating the likelihood of a tape allegedly showing him watching prostitutes urinating in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research into renewable biofuels can help cut emissions
While electric cars and the Semi Tesla have dominated news outlets in recent years, one issue seems to elude renewable energy - airplanes.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that allows renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Department of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Sciences who began work on this project in 2003.
His laboratory is developing a hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fatty wastes such as restaurant fat, animal fats and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower quality oils during production, resulting in an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than petroleum fuels, and also use waste from other industries in the process.
This technology is designed to mimic the hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
"What our first-generation technology has done," Bressler said, "is [actually creating] hydrocarbons, which are identical molecules to diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility for the use of biofuels, previously developed biofuel products tended to destabilize at lower temperatures, which was a serious risk in high-altitude aircraft.
"The aviation fuel problem is a bit of a vicious cycle," said Bressler.
It is actually worth less than diesel, but has higher requirements.
The Bressler Laboratory is currently looking at two options for producing aviation biofuel.
The first option is a low risk approach that requires additional treatment of the hydrocarbon biofuel and addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue to work on partially developed chemical properties that will keep the fuel stable, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with the chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a bit," said Bressler, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The University of Alberta spin-off company, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working to commercialize the product as airlines, as well as the Canadian and US military are increasing investment in the revolving option.
"They can imagine times when things could turn around and be subject to a carbon tax," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will act as a contingency plan.
Forge currently operates a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center and recently received $ 4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support the $ 25 million construction of a manufacturing facility in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce approximately 19 million liters of biofuel annually.
Bressler also notes that the projected carbon reduction will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transportation and fuel production are holding back further carbon reductions.
"As a technology specialist," said Bressler, "
I am tasked with developing options that enable informed decisions and many choices. "
Zamość: Another cheating on the granddaughter
8 thousand A resident of Zamość lost PLN and 750 euro thinking that she was helping her grandson who caused the accident.
The police about the incident was informed on Thursday by the son of the deceived Zamość woman.
“The woman was called on Wednesday by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he will go to prison.
Wanting to help her grandson, the senior woman donated 8,000 PLN and 750 euro to a fake policeman who came to her house ", reports the asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubiło from the Zamość police.
The policemen are looking for the perpetrator and once again call for caution:
“Every phone call asking for financial aid needs to be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotions and in a hurry.
Remember that policemen do not ask for money and do not accept money.
If we receive a phone call asking for financial support that raises our suspicions, we should react immediately and notify the Police by calling the emergency number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about the risks, let's inform how fraudsters work.
Please be cautious and not trust the people who call and ask for a loan.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that in the event of a retraction of Britain's Brexit, Riots like in Los Angeles are threatened, and he is calling for peace
One of the main ministers of the cabinet said yesterday evening that the country is in danger of a "social spike" if the original result is called into question by the result of the second referendum.
Allies of the British Prime Minister in his immediate vicinity have warned that the country is threatened by civil unrest on the scale of the "yellow vest" protests in France due to social inequality and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson called for "calm moods" during a heated argument over the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "surrender."
Despite his calls for peace, the cabinet minister told The Times: "There have never been protests in this country, such as the" gilets jaunes "(" yellow vest ") demonstrations or the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
People think it's impossible just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example - the gilets jaunes - they use encrypted telephones through which they can coordinate pickets, and a few unfriendly populist leaders are enough to push people to protest.
The riots in Los Angeles broke out after a jury acquitted four white policemen who beat up black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests - the gilet jaunes - have been ravaging and devastating the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The minister referred to Johnson's warning in the House of Commons and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU there will be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people vote and 66% of them vote for Britain to remain in the European Union, ten million citizens will remain dissatisfied," said the minister.
Even if 99% of them ignore this result, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their MP and will not let go.
It doesn't take much to see tens of thousands of people on the street soon.
One of the cabinet's main ministers added that the country was in danger of a "social spike" if the result of the first referendum was called into question by the result of the second.
Johnson called for a general election in which voters would decide the fate of Brexit.
According to reports, the prime minister faces the risk of a government revolt that wants to lower demands in connection with Brexit and to reach a compromise agreement with the EU instead.
Hołownia, Czubówna and Krosny delighted in Krakow.
Talk'N "Roll is behind us
On Thursday (September 26), over 300 participants listened to 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, including Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
All this as part of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which was held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Broadening horizons, talking about ideas worth publicizing and joint discussions that can become an impulse for further development.
This was the goal of the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting to the stage 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, including people known from the media - Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The slogan of this year's Talk'N'Roll edition was "Crafting the future, NOW" and the presentations of the guests invited to participate in the conference focused precisely on creating the future.
The first session was opened by the managing director of Saber Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who talked about how the brand that is built around itself can affect our future.
Richard Lucas took the stage to change the public's perception of rejection, arguing that rejection must be accepted if you want to create the future, while Chris Badura took up empathy in an age of rapid technological advancement.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP ​​Saber) shared insights and techniques that can help you manage your career and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right work-life balance.
The second part of the conference was opened by a multi-threaded conversation with Krystyna Czubówna, who talked about, among other things, how, from her perspective, the teaching profession has changed over the years in Poland.
The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that - thanks to the development of technology - today anyone can work in this profession.
He does not think, however, that in the next few years the lecturer will be completely replaced by technology.
Soon after it, Piotr Nabielec took up the problem of life in times of information and emotional overload, or overload in terms of choice, providing the audience with valuable tips on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętocha in his speech talked about what the next industrial revolution could lead to, known as "Industry 4.0".
By playing he teaches, by teaching he is entertaining
The conference organizers also took care of the artistic impressions by inviting the illusionist Daniel Jedynak to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first entertained the audience with a pantonym, and then - on the example of his own career - talked about how to maintain the right balance between a career on stage and private life.
The participants were also kidnapped by Szymon Hołownia, emphasizing the role of time in our lives.
The columnist pointed out that even two minutes can change the situation dramatically and you have to be ready to use this time.
In addition, Hołownia shared his thoughts on the reality around us, recalling anecdotes that could make the viewers smile.
Then Adrian Tworuszka appeared on stage, who reviewed the history and goals of several models of innovation and related them to how they are used today.
Finally, Marcin Słowiak, using the Rubik's cube as an example, talked about the approach to problem solving.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new to the perception of the reality of everyone who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to the great commitment of the audience.
The organizers provided a broadcast for everyone who could not participate in the event in person, and the recordings of the lectures are available on the website.
Rule of law instead of rule of law.
"Despite the lack of a sufficient number of votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority introduced a number of changes to the state system, posing threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of the tripartite division of powers," writes the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights in a report published on Thursday.
The report "Rule of law instead of the rule of law" documents, inter alia, changes in the administration of justice and in the area of ​​protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR) released a report on Thursday entitled “Rule of law instead of rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015–2019 ”.
The Foundation estimates in the report that in the years 2015-2019 there was the greatest regression in the field of human rights protection in Poland after 1989.
“Despite the lack of a sufficient number of votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority introduced a number of changes to the state system, posing threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers.
By adjusting the law to political goals, the rule of law has been replaced with the rule of law, 'write HFHR experts.
What in the HFHR report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of the judiciary, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarizes the three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
“In the last four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the law to pursue particular party interests.
This translated into the ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as the weakening of the entire system of human rights protection in Poland, emphasized Marcin Wolny, lawyer, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years have been "a period of systemic changes both in the state" and "in the field of human rights protection".
Over the past four years, the Sejm has adopted over 20 key legal acts from the point of view of human rights protection.
"The changes were often adopted at a hasty pace, without public consultations and despite the reservations of legal circles, the Ombudsman or international organizations," explained lawyer Małgorzata Szuleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed in the last four years are: "weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecution), failure to respect binding court judgments and recommendations of international institutions, and weakening of human rights safeguards."
State authorities did not react
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered "those situations in which state authorities did not react or directly disregarded cases of aggression" as particularly disturbing.
The foundation's experts noticed that some changes were introduced in an atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of the state's activity in the field of limiting the principles of the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from entities of international law.
"Failure to implement these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader of democratic changes in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also exposes the Polish state to liability for violations of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," reads the report.
The brother of a Pakistani social media star with a life sentence for an honor killing
Women's rights experts say justice is often difficult due to the length of proceedings, the release of suspected killers on bail and the blurring of the public mind.
"It takes so long that people forget," says Farzana Bari, a women's rights activist and founder of Pakistan's first gender studies department at the university, and adds that even the high-profile Baloch murder case was dealt with for over three years.
Although reliable data is difficult to establish according to women's rights groups, Pakistan's Human Rights Commission found at least 300 cases of so-called honor killings.
Many activists say the actual figure is much higher, and the honor-based crime awareness network estimates that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings committed worldwide each year.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, remittances to the country are decreasing because many emigrants settle outside Poland permanently - reports the Friday Rzeczpospolita.
The latest report by Euro-Tax shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries in 2018 amounted to over PLN 8.6 thousand. PLN, which means that they increased by almost a thousand zlotys, or almost 12 percent.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish economic emigrants in EU countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than a year earlier," we read.
Director of the Center for Migration Research at the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk, says that Poles are getting better at the international labor market, where they use various options available.
"There is also a growing number of specialists and professionals who, in search of better and better conditions, move from country to country, as do employees of international corporations," the newspaper reports.
Some Euro-Tax clients work in two countries during the year, eg Great Britain and Germany.
“It was in Germany in 2018 that the total earnings of Polish emigrants increased the most, by 11 percent (to nearly PLN 27 billion).
However, Poles in the UK earned the most - almost PLN 35 billion, ”we read.
The president of Euro-Tax believes that despite the improvement in working conditions on the Polish market, the number of economic emigrants is not decreasing.
For still saxes in the West and North of Europe (headed by Norway) are often a chance for earnings several times higher than in Poland.
"And this even with the minimum wages in a given country, which in Germany, for example, are 9.5-11.7 euro per hour," reports the daily.
Rzeczpospolita reports that Poles stay not only because of higher earnings, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles have their roots abroad, which can also be seen in the declining remittances to the country.
Last year's were the lowest in years.
As economist Tadeusz Chrościcki reminds, the group of people transferring money to the country decreases along with the extension of the period of stay abroad and the amount of money decreases.
"Emigrants draw their relatives to each other", we read in "Rzeczpospolita" on Friday.
The protracted monsoons cause flooding and chaos in many parts of India
The monsoon season in India has been extending by almost a month, and unprecedented rainfall causes death from collapsing buildings and the rotting of many crops.
Usually in northern India, the monsoon subsides in early September, but the average rainfall this month is 37% above the norm.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest monsoon in decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unheard of - recently in the city of Pune in the west of India, heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday have resulted in the death of several people and devastation from collapsing buildings.
Houses were flooded, people trudged through the streets knee-deep in the water, which normally only happens at the height of the monsoons.
Heavy rainfall also occurred in cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad.
Many houses have been destroyed in the northern state of Uttarakhand due to prolonged rains.
The monsoon also started late.
Water was scarce in many areas, so farmers prepared for a likely drought.
Farmers do not welcome too long a monsoon.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
"Because of him, my vegetables - and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes - will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a small farmer farmer in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand state.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and late monsoons means an increase in the price of onions, which is an indispensable ingredient in Indian dishes.
Onions, which usually cost 20 rupees (0.23 British pounds), currently costs 80 rupees (approx. 1 British pounds) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
Another major festival is the Dasara festival on October 8, during which Hindus raise huge comic-book-like effigies of Ravana, a character with a lush mustache and a sinister smile from the epic Ramayana.
Smoking Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's images are made of paper, if the monsoons continue, Ravana will have the last laugh.

Doodle celebrating Google's 21st birthday
It would be difficult to imagine a world today without Google.
In the search engine we look for answers to all questions that bother us.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is this?", "Where?", "How?" and how much?" are one of the favorite categories searched by Poles.
The giant's data shows that last year we were eager to ask, among others about "Where's the storm?", "How to make asparagus?" and "How many fingers does a horse have?", "How do I get rid of fruit flies?", "How to eat kaki?".
Today, the search engine is celebrating its twenty-first birthday today.
Its users - and in Poland as much as 96 percent. people use "Uncle Google" - today welcomes a special Google Doodle.
This time it's not animated.
Google reminds you of its birthday by showing a desktop computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and a digital date printed in the lower right corner - like in a photo from the 90s.
Cataloging information
The search engine was created for a specific purpose - it was to catalog all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Its name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol meaning ten raised to the hundredth power.
The name was also meant to reflect the company's intention to index as many pages as possible from the world's Internet resources.
The Google search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationships between the parties, which performed better than the methods of simply sorting the results based on the frequency of the given phrase.
In the beginning, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to a given result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under the name of Google Inc. On September 7, 1998, and soon after they launched the now famous website google.com.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" published information about the extremely high relevance of Google search results.
Then the history of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development each month, conquering new markets and increasing the company's value.
As early as June 2000, Google's URL index has over a billion positions, which makes the work of Page and Brin the largest Internet search engine in the world.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brin is one of the leading players in the IT market.
So is there any room for development?
"The mission of Google is to organize the world's information resources so that they are universally available and useful, although we have made great progress in this field, we still have a very long way to achieve this goal," Piotr Zalewski assured in an interview with "Newsweek" from Google Poland.
Frequent exposure to pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that working with exposure to high concentrations of plant protection products may translate into a high risk of developing heart problems later in life.
This was the case with the group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii who had been studied for over 30 years.
The researchers found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the most contact with them were 45% more likely to develop heart disease or stroke.
"This study highlights the need for PPE when dealing with pesticides at work, and the importance of keeping records of exposure to pesticides at work in medical records, as well as controlling standard risk factors for heart disease," said study co-author Dr Beatriz Rodriguez.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa district.
The results were based on data from more than 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu cardiology program.
As the researchers pointed out, the results of the study may not be applicable to women and other populations as it only concerned men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so their effects on health may become apparent years after exposure to these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed 10 years after exposure to plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez said: "After 34 years of observing the men, it turned out that the link between pesticide exposure and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant."
This was probably because aging factors became more important, masking possible cause-and-effect relationships between exposure to pesticides and cardiovascular disease incidence later in life.
Researchers found no significant relationship between exposure to low to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zelenski-Trump phone call: Poroshenko adds his three cents
Washington's policy has had a turbulent week with impeachment proceedings launched against US President Donald Trump
For a political debutant Volodymyr Zelensky, getting involved in a political scandal is a situation he would rather avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelensky-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching consequences for the former?
Almost at the beginning of the telephone conversation, Trump told Zelensky that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes released by the White House are not complete, they detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for engaging in negotiations with other European leaders rather than putting forward specific proposals.
The controversy was aroused by Zelensky's response, who said that he did not agree with Trump 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenskiy added that both French President Macron and Merkel are trying insufficiently to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, to speak up through social networking sites.
Petro Poroshenko, the former president of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the support provided by the EU "was unprecedented."
In other tweets, Poroshenko said he was grateful for the EU support provided during the course of the "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others have expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska said: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?"
Trump then mentioned military assistance and asked Zelensky to investigate not one but two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden's son - Hunter - and the second related to the hacking of the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacking attack on e-mailboxes. -mail Democrats during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether this will spoil European relations or cause the severance of relations with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to speak badly about anyone ...
We would like to thank everyone who helped us, ”he said after the publication of the transcript of Zelensky's telephone conversation in New York at the UN General Assembly.
Zelenskiy is to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the Normandy Four, scheduled for October.
Former provincial inspector, validly acquitted
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of the alleged acts.
After 6 years, Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally acquitted of the charges.
The District Court in Przemyśl cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former head of the Provincial Inspectorate of Commercial Quality of Agricultural and Food Products in Rzeszów, of the charge of exceeding his powers.
The Lublin prosecutor's office accused him of revealing to the then voivodship marshal the date of the inspection at the plant producing cooking oil.
Recently, a final acquittal was passed in this case.
The appeal was examined on September 12.
“The court upheld the challenged acquittal,” confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, spokesman for the District Court in Przemyśl.
It is about the judgment of February 14 this year. issued by the District Court in Przemyśl.
Jerzy Wiśniewski then commented on him on Facebook: "It has been six years since the Appellate Prosecutor's Office in Lublin presented the allegation of breaking the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship on April 30, 2012.
The court clearly stated that I was innocent and I did not break the law at the time.
I was convinced that my telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Province at that time was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of the events made public by the media outlined in 2013 by the Appellate Prosecutor's Office in Lublin was not true and caused irreparable damage to both the food producer entrepreneur and the loss of my image among my employers, employees and the local community.
The indictment that was drawn up against me, in the opinion of the Court, contained a number of errors, untrue facts, unreliable definitions of legal grounds, events not confirmed in reality.
With the help of the CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
At that time, I was immediately dismissed from work and deprived of funds.
I was dependent on my wife for a long time. "
Let us remind you.
Jerzy Wiśniewski performed the function of the provincial inspector of the commercial quality of agricultural and food products in the years 2009–2013.
He was dismissed from his post after the prosecutor's office in Lublin charged him in 2013.
According to investigators, in a telephone conversation he was to reveal to the then voivodship marshal (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment) the date of the inspection at the cooking oil plant owned by the wife of the then Deputy Marshal of the Podkarpacie region.
This warning - as prosecutors from Lublin claimed - was supposed to make the owner of the company know about the inspection and correct the labels on oils, which were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard accusations of violating his powers, for which he was threatened with up to 3 years imprisonment.
“I am relieved that this case is finally over and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now finally confirmed by a final judgment acquitting me of the charges against me, comments Jerzy Wiśniewski.
The White House tried to hide the record of the conversation with Zelensky
In an edited report released on Thursday, the whistleblower wrote that President Donald Trump, talking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, sought foreign interference in the US elections, and the White House tried to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated August 12, the whistleblower, who is possibly an intelligence officer, wrote: "As part of my official duties, I have been informed by many members of the US government that the president was using his position to demand foreign country interference in the 2020 elections in the United States. United ".
“Trump used part of the conversation (with Zelensky) to pursue his own interests.
More precisely - he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in his re-election in 2020, ”reads the report, quoted by The Hill daily.
The Ukrainian leader was "made to understand" that his contacts with Trump would depend on his "showing a willingness to play" in matters about which President Rudy Giuliani's lawyer would have informed him.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but emphasizes that he was informed in detail about its content by "many White House officials who had direct information about it" and that their accounts coincided.
"In the days following this conversation, I learned from many American officials that high-ranking White House officials intervened to" seal "all archival records of this conversation, especially a verbatim record that was drafted as is usually done in White House crisis room, ”we read on.
"High-ranking White House officials told me that White House lawyers" ordered "them to remove the electronic record from the information system that stores such records.
The record has been transferred to a separate electronic system that is typically used to store and manipulate sensitive information, ”wrote the report's author.
"In my opinion, these steps show that White House officials realized the importance of what happened during the interview," said the whistleblower.
As the AP agency comments, this document is likely to speed up the proceedings regarding the president's possible impeachment, and also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this account.
The recording of the conversation with Zelensky, the White House, after pressure from Congress, was made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but based on the accounts of people who had witnessed it.
The content of the report, in an edited version, was revealed a day later by the House of Representatives intelligence committee.
Also on Thursday, the acting director of US intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the House of Representatives intelligence committee and explained how he had dealt with the intelligence report.
Maguire said the whistleblower made the right choice and followed the law.
He also stressed that, in his opinion, the matter of the conversation with Zelensky is an "unprecedented" event.
Democrats in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he had blocked the whistleblower's report from being made available to Congress; the intelligence director replied that he had no authority to disclose its content, the confidential nature of which was guaranteed by the so-called privilege of the executive.
Part of Maguire's questioning by committee was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that due to suspicion that the president was putting pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she assessed that the transcript of Trump's conversation with Zelensky confirms that the US president had broken the election and security standards.
US election law prohibits the use of foreign aid.
However, the Ministry of Justice assessed that the president did not break the electoral law. On Thursday, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said there was "nothing wrong with the interview," and the report "had nothing more than a compilation of third-hand reports and press clippings taped together."
"The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and the false narrative propagated by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana has won two prestigious awards at the ongoing 40th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The Safety Award was awarded in recognition of Ghana's achievement of the highest Aviation Safety Oversight Score in Africa, ie 89.89 percent on the Interim Successful Implementation (EI) rate.
This came about when ICAO completed its ICVM audit on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Agency's Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program.
The Security Award recognized the country's high commitment to implementing ICAO-recommended security standards and protocols at Ghana's airports and airspace.

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who is the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), smiles as he testifies at a meeting of the Senate Subcommittee on National Security Budgetary Committee on FEMA's fiscal 2020 fiscal proposal on Capitoline Hill in Washington, USA on April 3, 2019.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said in an announcement on Thursday that US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, an Assistant Administrator of FEMA, serves as head of the agency that oversees the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes and forest fires.
The agency had operated without an administrator approved by the US Senate since March, when Brock Long vacated the position.
Long resigned after the United States Department of Homeland Security, to which FEMA reports, that Long was misusing government vehicles between Washington and his North Carolina home.
Another candidate for the position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough background check revealed allegations that he was involved in a bar brawl.
Gaynor's nomination for the position was expected.
A majority in the Senate will be required to approve his nomination for this role.
The White House reported that before Gaynor became Assistant Administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marines.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, a Norwegian runner, is considering a toe amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized in 1500 meters, winning the gold medal in the European championship in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the European runner-up in 5000 meters from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new ailment and that he had already undergone one operation right after the 2016 Olympics, but that the pains had returned and had worsened this season.
The pain makes me place my foot differently, which in turn alters my body layout, other unnatural stresses occur, and I begin to feel pain elsewhere, such as my hip.
For this reason, I could not prepare enough for the World Cup, and for the past two weeks the pain has been so severe that I have difficulty putting on the spikes - said the runner on the NRK TV channel.
The father and coach of the player Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with his son, they came to the conclusion that the only solution for him not to end his career and participate in next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only solution, although a drastic one, and the decision has already been made.
"If a part of your body hurts you should get rid of it, and Henrik doesn't really need that finger that much, so forget about the cosmetic aspect in this situation," he explained.
Police Shuts Down Illegal E-Cigarette Cannabis Plant In San Gabriel Valley - CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) - Police closed an illegal e-cigarette factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
An office building at 9600 Telstar Avenue was raided around 4:37 PM, during which police searched for illegal marijuana e-cigarettes for sale and found large jars containing butane hash oil, a cannabis concentrate.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police Department, officers also found a device that was used to refill vaping cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who once worked with drugs, says distilling the oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"A simple electrostatic spark from our clothes can ignite these fumes, causing not only a fire but, due to the concentration, even an explosion," he says.
“If we have many jars and the like in a room, one explosion will result in another one, causing not only a fire, but an explosion that could wipe out the entire complex.
A special task team was called to the office building to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At present, the value of confiscated products and equipment is unknown.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to obtain a search warrant that detected illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to find out who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person had set up a business in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officers want to make sure that illegal products do not hit the streets, given recent articles on the dangers of vaping.
"People don't really know what products they're buying," says Cano.
“They can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This can pose a risk to our community and children, so we always caution them against reaching for these kinds of things.

Display of the lost dress of Elizabeth I at Hampton Court Palace
Interwoven with silver thread, the dress made of the finest silk chamotte has been exquisitely decorated with embroidery depicting vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces foundation exhibition, that meant only one thing.
The faded fabric that had been hanging for 100 years on the wall of the tiny village parish church that she looked at could have only been a missing piece of clothing by Elizabeth I.
Three years after Lynn accidentally stumbled upon the sumptuous altar cloth in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost robe is due to be on display next month at Hampton Court Palace, close to the same rooms where the Tudor Queen may have worn it over 450 years ago.
The measure of the significance of this discovery is that of the entire collection of royal dresses, only one more element of the 16th-century dress has survived.
While there is no compelling evidence that Elizabeth will ever wear this gown, three years of research have led experts to believe that it must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Srebrogłów", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and a bear, indicates that the garment belonged to the most eminent person .
The dress, at the time it was sewn, might have cost the equivalent of a Tudor estate.
"Moreover, in the 1690s, the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt threatened by other women at court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such refined fabrics," says Lynn.
“As this is a very important statement, I asked many people in the community to look at the dress.
I really enjoyed the fact that when they saw the dress, they were also delighted with it and were practically convinced that we have an element of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
The long re-life of the gown, trimmed to serve as an altar cloth in dark St Faith's Church in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it may seem.
Bacton is the settlement from which Blanche Parry came, the closest lady of the court to Elizabeth, who served the queen throughout her long life and with whom the fabric was identified in local legends.
Although the dress was made after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth must have donated it to the Parry family or parish in memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After over a thousand hours of restoration work, four hundred of which have been spent on the finest hand sewing using specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will be on display next to the "Rainbow Portrait" portrait, one of the most famous paintings of the time, borrowed by the Hatfield House Palace. depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar gown.
"When working with historic textiles, you really begin to respect the craftsmanship of the people who made them," says Libby Thompson, head of restoration, most of which took place in the converted greenhouse at Hampton Court Palace - the only space large enough to accommodate some of the priceless palace tapestries.
“Looking at the embroidery on the front and back, I began to feel a great deal of respect for those who did it.
I've never worked on something this elite.
The exhibition entitled The Lost Dress of Elizabeth opens on October 12 at Hampton Court Palace
Fitch agency confirmed Poland's rating with a stable outlook
The Fitch agency confirmed on Friday the long-term rating of Poland in foreign currency at "A-" - the press release said.
The rating outlook remained stable.
"The Fitch agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-diversified economy, which is supported by a sensible economic policy and a strong banking sector," reads the statement of the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the peak of the business cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product in Poland will be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.
The agency forecasts that the general government deficit to GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below 3 percent, 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively.
According to the agency, the government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2019 will be 50.5 percent, and in the following years it will be lower (on average, 48.3 percent in 2020-2021), we read.
Rating of Poland
SP and Moody's will end the autumn round of reviews of Poland's rating on October 11.
According to Fitch, Poland's rating remains the same as that issued at the end of March 2019.
Then the agency confirmed Poland's rating at "A-" with a stable outlook.
Among the three largest rating agencies, Moody's scores the highest for Poland's creditworthiness - at the "A2" level.
According to Fitch and SP, Poland's rating is "A-", one level lower than Moody's.
All ratings are stable.
What is Rating?
Rating agencies are created to help investors assess the risk of their investment activities.
The rating is awarded to companies, banks and countries.
In the case of the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
The rating is nothing more than the assessment of creditworthiness.
On its basis, decisions are made about who and how much to borrow money.
Sometimes this information also suggests who is best not to grant any loans at all, because there is a high risk that the money will not be recovered.
A lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest on the loan.
Each assessment must be justified and argued.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case the agencies run the risk of losing their reputation.
Currently, more than 90 percent of the global credit rating market is controlled by three agencies: Standard Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own rating system.
Confederation Five: First 1000 plus
The "Confederation Five", ie the main assumptions of the election program, was presented on Friday in Koszalin by the candidates to the Sejm from constituency 40, applying for a mandate from the KW list Konfederacja Wolność i Niepodległość.
The leader of the Koszalin list to the Sejm, Krzysztof Chmielewski, presented the slogans of "Confederation Five".
"First, the 1000 plus program for Poland, secondly, quick and fair courts, thirdly, a cultural voucher and an educational voucher, fourthly, national security, and fifth, it is a healthy life," said Chmielewski.
He noted that "Poles must finally start earning a decent income", therefore the Confederation wants to eliminate the income tax and - as Chmielewski said - "the problem with the tax-free amount will solve itself".
"Poles must be given a choice where to save their money for retirement, ie zero PIT and voluntary Social Insurance Institution for all," said the leader of the list about the assumptions of the "1000 plus program for Poland".
On the other hand, Aleksandra Zadencka, starting from the second place on the list, referring to the program slogan "healthy life" said that "food is of increasingly poorer quality" and in order to change this, it is necessary to "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", act for crops free from GMO.

She also spoke out on behalf of her group in favor of "voluntary vaccinations".

The Mexican cartel boss is behind a third of the drugs in the US
Chicago - Just after sunrise on the West Side of Chicago, CBS News reported a morning drug hunt.
Brian McKnight of the DEA has made it clear what is happening.
In Chicago, nearly 800 people died of drug overdoses last year.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of Chicago's drugs come from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord, Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.
"He is the number one priority for the DEA and directly for the US federal enforcement," said Matthew Donahue, DEA's principal agent in Mexico.
The prize for El Mencho reaches $ 10 million.
He helped discover the dozens of drug labs located in the jungle of El Mencho.
El Mencho Cartel's Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least a third of the drugs reaching the US by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
There is a $ 10 million prize on El Mencho's head.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he formed a brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPG, 50 caliber weapons.
It basically has its own SWAT teams, ”added Donahue.
El Mencho protects his empire with impunity, using measures such as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in a public hang this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to the Mexican government's statistics, there are approximately 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be dealt with without protective equipment.
In the laboratory, packets of cocaine are labeled with the smuggler's brand name.
For more than a third of them, the traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending the poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone's child dies, according to Donahue, there is a "good chance" that the drugs come from the El Mencho organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died of an overdose.

Run, jerk and fight - Sport
On Saturday, the first league Stomil will take up Podbeskidzie and he wants to win.
Stomil players have been undefeated for three rounds.
Piotr Zajączkowski's players scored seven points during this time, because they won with Stal Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match there was a goalless draw in Suwałki.
Now the team from Olsztyn on Saturday at 18 will take Podbeskidzie, which is mentioned as one of the favorites for promotion to the Ekstraklasa.
The closest rivals of Stomil are fourth in the table and have a point advantage over the team from Olsztyn.
Podbeskidzie played six times this season and scored two wins, draws and defeats, while Stomil feels very well at his facility - at the stadium at al. Piłsudskiego 69a, the team of Piotr Zajączkowski won three times and lost once.
Altogether, the players from Olsztyn in ten rounds accumulated 17 points and are in the lead of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the tournament, nothing announced that.
“Any changes need time to be effective,” explains Piotr Skiba.
“And finally, we have something to do with us, we have believed in ourselves, and we can work under normal conditions.
We only focused on playing football.
There are clean heads, there is a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff ”.
On Tuesday, the players of Stomil eliminated Ruch Chorzów from the Polish Cup, but they needed extra time and a series of penalties.
Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to the south of Poland, because coach Zajączkowski gave these key players a rest before Saturday's match against Podbeskidzie.
In Chorzów, however, Jakub Mosakowski, who returned from an injury, scored his long-awaited goal.
"It's always nice to score a goal, and I scored at such a point that we can continue to play in the cups (Mosakowski equalized for 3-3 in the 119th minute - ed.).
Dad bit me a lot and laughed that I couldn't score, and I always told him that I would score when he didn't expect it.
Now Mosakowski is counting on a return to the basic squad, the more so as Oleh Tarasenko cannot play due to the yellow cards.
"That's why I work hard in training to be able to play in the first squad," says Mosakowski.
“In Chorzów, I did everything to present myself as well as possible.
However, whether I play or sit on the bench, I will support the team just as much.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the match against Podbeskidzie.
Certainly, we will face a tough game in which we will have to run out, tear out and fight for the victory.
In the middle of the defense in Olsztyn, Rafał Remisz may also play, who has recently also contracted an injury, so we will find out whether he will perform on Saturday, especially as coach Zajączkowski, traditionally, tries to keep personnel matters secret until the end.

An intensive campaign is also conducted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who, as the leader of the Silesian PiS list, is a frequent guest in this region.
Each meeting is carefully planned, including the appropriate setting.
This was also the case, or rather it was supposed to be, in Piekary Śląskie.
It is known - a special guest should be specially greeted.
Before the meeting with the Prime Minister, the chairman present in the room decided to conduct a dress rehearsal.
Like a seasoned bellboy, he tried to get the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
“It will not be a greeting for me, but for Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Also louder, louder my friends! ”He encouraged enthusiastically.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not fully carried away by the host's hot persuasions and reluctantly replied "Ma-te-uh", but the recording of the enthusiastic bellwether makes a sensation on the web.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of the murder of his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stay family home on July 9, 2014, demanding that he disclose the whereabouts of his wife, Melannie Haskell, from whom he was separated.
She was not there, but there was her sister Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys, ages 13 and 4, and two girls, ages 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.
Only one family member survived, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
Authorities said she was badly injured but has recovered completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of insanity.
The jury will meet again on Monday to pass judgment.
Quantum Internet getting closer to reality - ScienceDaily
The results of US military research are taking the quantum internet a step closer.
Such an internet could offer military security, detection and time keeping accuracy capabilities not available with traditional networking approaches.
The Distributed Quantum Information Processing Center of the US Military Research Laboratory for the Development of Combat Capability looked at researchers at the University of Insbruck who achieved record-breaking entanglement transfer between matter and light - 50 kilometers using fiber-optic cables.
Entanglement is a correlation that can arise between quanta such as qubits.
When two qubits become entangled and one of them is measured, this will have an impact on the measurement of the other, even if the other qubit is physically distant.
"These [50 kilometers] are two orders of magnitude further than was previously possible and a feasible distance to start building intercity quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and principal investigator on the project, whose findings have been published in the journal Nature, Quantum Information section.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of qubit physical networks that are entangled with each other despite the large physical distance.
Researchers concluded that this entangled state dispersion is essential for the creation of a quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a major step forward towards achieving a distributed, entangled state on a large scale," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-director of the military program supporting this research.
The quality of the entangled state at the other end after the optical fiber has traveled is also high enough to meet some of the requirements of some of the toughest applications of quantum networks.
The research team started the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser beams, the researchers entered the quantum state into the ion and excited it at the same time so that it would emit a photon containing quantum information.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to send a photon over a fiber optic cable.
"The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the optical fiber," said Lanyon.
Therefore, his team initially sent a light particle through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser beam.
The photon wavelength has been converted to an optimal value for long-distance transmission - the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through a 50-kilometer long fiber optic cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and light particles continued to be entangled even after transforming the wavelength and traveling this distance.
“The decision to choose calcium means that this result paves a direct way for the formation of a tangled network of atomic clocks over long physical distances, since calcium can be entrapped with a high-quality 'clock' qubit.
The army is very interested in large-scale, tangled clock networks because of its precision positioning, precise navigation and time synchronization applications, ”said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
